      "mr. mrs. dursley, of number four, privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. they were last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense. mr. dursley was director of a firm called grunnings, which made drills. he was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. mrs. dursley was thin blonde had nearly twice usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on neighbors. dursley s had a small son called dudley in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. they didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about potters. mrs. was mrs. dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, mrs. dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister her good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be. dursleys shuddered to think what neighbors would say if potters arrived in street. dursleys knew that potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. this boy was another good reason for keeping potters away; they didn’t want dudley mixing with a child like that. when mr. mrs. dursley woke up on dull, gray tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange mysterious things would soon be happening all over country. mr. dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, mrs. dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair. none of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past window. at half past eight, mr. dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked mrs. dursley on cheek, tried to kiss dudley good-bye but missed, because dudley was now having a tantrum throwing his cereal at walls. tyke,” chortled mr. dursley as he left house. he got into his car backed out of number four’s drive. it was on corner of street that he noticed first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map. for a second, mr. dursley didn’t realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again. there was a tabby cat standing on corner of privet drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. what could he have been thinking of? it must have been a trick of light. mr. dursley blinked stared at cat. it stared back. as mr. dursley drove around corner up road, he watched cat in his mirror. it was now reading sign that said privet drive no, looking at sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. mr. dursley gave himself a little shake put cat out of his mind. as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. but on edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. as he sat in usual morning traffic jam, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. people in cloaks. mr. dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes getups you saw on young people! he supposed this was some stupid new fashion. he drummed his fingers on steering wheel his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. they were whispering excitedly together. mr. dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, wearing an emerald-green cloak! nerve of him! but then it struck mr. dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something ... yes, that would be it. traffic moved on a few minutes later, mr. dursley arrived in grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. mr. dursley always sat with his back to window in his office on ninth floor. if he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. he didn’t see owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in street did; they pointed gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. mr. dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. he yelled at five different people. he made several important telephone calls shouted a bit more. he was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs walk across road to buy himself a bun from bakery. he’d forgotten all about people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to baker’s. he eyed them angrily as he passed. he didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. this bunch were whispering excitedly, too, he couldn’t see a single collecting tin. it was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. potters, that’s right, that’s what i heard yes, their son, mr. dursley stopped dead. fear flooded him. he looked back at whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. he dashed back across road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. he put receiver back down stroked his mustache, thinking ... no, he was being stupid. wasn’t such an unusual name. he was sure there were lots of people called who had a son called harry. come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his nephew was called harry. he’d never even seen boy. it might have been harvey. or harold. there was no point in worrying mrs. dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. he didn’t blame her if he’d had a sister like that ... but all same, those people in cloaks ... he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon when he left building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside door. he grunted, as tiny old man stumbled almost fell. it was a few seconds before mr. dursley realized that man was wearing a violet cloak. he didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to ground. on contrary, his face split into a wide smile he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! rejoice, for you- know-who has gone at last! even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!” old man hugged mr. dursley around middle walked off. mr. dursley stood rooted to spot. he had been hugged by a complete stranger. he also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was. he was rattled. he hurried to his car set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination. as he pulled into driveway of number four, first thing he saw it didn’t improve his mood was tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. it was now sitting on his garden wall. he was sure it was same one; it had same markings around its eyes. said mr. dursley loudly. cat didn’t move. it just gave him a stern look. was this normal cat behavior? mr. dursley wondered. trying to pull himself together, he let himself into house. he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. mrs. dursley had had a nice, normal day. she told him over dinner all about mrs. next door’s problems with her daughter how dudley had learned a new word (“won’t!”). mr. dursley tried to act normally. when dudley had been put to bed, he went into living room in time to catch last report on evening news: finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. although owls normally hunt at night are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. experts are unable to explain why owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” newscaster allowed himself a grin. mysterious. now, over to jim mcguffin with weather. going to be any more showers of owls tonight, jim?” ted,” said weatherman, don’t know about that, but it’s not only owls that have been acting oddly today. viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of rain i promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it’s not until next week, folks! but i can promise a wet night tonight.” mr. dursley sat frozen in his armchair. shooting stars all over britain? owls flying by daylight? mysterious people in cloaks all over place? a whisper, a whisper about potters . . . mrs. dursley came into living room carrying two cups of tea. it was no good. he’d have to say something to her. he cleared his throat nervously. petunia, dear you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?” as he had expected, mrs. dursley looked shocked angry. after all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister. she said sharply. stuff on news,” mr. dursley mumbled. . . . shooting stars . . . there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today ...” snapped mrs. dursley. i just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... her crowd.” mrs. dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. mr. dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard name he decided he didn’t dare. instead he said, as casually as he could, son he’d be about dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” suppose so,” said mrs. dursley stiffly. his name again? howard, isn’t it?” nasty, common name, if you ask me.” yes,” said mr. dursley, his heart sinking horribly. i quite agree.” he didn’t say another word on subject as they went upstairs to bed. while mrs. dursley was in bathroom, mr. dursley crept to bedroom window peered down into front garden. cat was still there. it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something. was he imagining things? could all this have anything to do with potters? if it did ... if it got out that they were related to a pair of well, he didn’t think he could bear it. dursleys got into bed. mrs. dursley fell asleep quickly but mr. dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. his last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him mrs. dursley. potters knew very well what he petunia thought about them their kind. ... he couldn’t see how he petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned turned over it couldn’t affect them. ... how very wrong he was. mr. dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but cat on wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. it was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on far corner of privet drive. it didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. in fact, it was nearly midnight before cat moved at all. a man appeared on corner cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of ground. cat’s tail twitched its eyes narrowed. nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive. he was tall, thin, very old, judging by silver of his hair beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. he was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept ground, high-heeled, buckled boots. his blue eyes were light, bright, sparkling behind half-moon spectacles his nose was very long crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. this man’s name was albus dumbledore. albus dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. he was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. but he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at cat, which was still staring at him from other end of street. for some reason, sight of cat seemed to amuse him. he chuckled muttered, should have known.” he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. he flicked it open, held it up in air, clicked it. nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. he clicked it again next lamp flickered into darkness. twelve times he clicked put-outer, until only lights left on whole street were two tiny pinpricks in distance, which were eyes of cat watching him. if anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed mrs. dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on pavement. dumbledore slipped put- outer back inside his cloak set off down street toward number four, where he sat down on wall next to cat. he didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. seeing you here, professor mcgonagall.” he turned to smile at tabby, but it had gone. instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly shape of markings cat had had around its eyes. she, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. she looked distinctly ruffled. did you know it was me?” she asked. dear professor, i’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said professor mcgonagall. day? when you could have been celebrating? i must have passed a dozen feasts parties on my way here.” professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily. yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. think they’d be a bit more careful, but no even muggles have noticed something’s going on. it was on their news.” she jerked her head back at dursleys’ dark living-room window. heard it. flocks of owls ... shooting stars. ... well, they’re not completely stupid. they were bound to notice something. shooting stars down in kent i’ll bet that was dedalus diggle. he never had much sense.” can’t blame them,” said dumbledore gently. had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” know that,” said professor mcgonagall irritably. that’s no reason to lose our heads. people are being downright careless, out on streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in muggle clothes, swapping rumors.” she threw a sharp, sideways glance at dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. fine thing it would be if, on very day you-know-who seems to have disappeared at last, muggles found out about us all. i suppose he really has gone, dumbledore?” certainly seems so,” said dumbledore. have much to be thankful for. would you care for a lemon drop?” what?” lemon drop. they’re a kind of muggle sweet i’m rather fond of.” thank you,” said professor mcgonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was moment for lemon drops. i say, even if you-know-who has gone dear professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? all this you- know-who’ nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: voldemort.” professor mcgonagall flinched, but dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. all gets so confusing if we keep saying you-know-who.’ i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort’s name.” know you haven’t,” said professor mcgonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. you’re different. everyone knows you’re only one you- know- oh, all right, voldemort, was frightened of.” flatter me,” said dumbledore calmly. had powers i will never have.” because you’re too well noble to use them.” lucky it’s dark. i haven’t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore said, owls are nothing next to rumors that are flying around. you know what everyone’s saying? about why he’s disappeared? about what finally stopped him?” it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached point she was most anxious to discuss, real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. it was plain that whatever was saying, she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true. dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop did not answer. they’re saying,” she pressed on, that last night voldemort turned up in godric’s hollow. he went to find potters. rumor is that lily james are are that they’re dead.” dumbledore bowed his head. professor mcgonagall gasped. james ... i can’t believe it ... i didn’t want to believe it ... oh, albus ...” dumbledore reached out patted her on shoulder. know ... i know ...” he said heavily. professor mcgonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. not all. they’re saying he tried to kill potters’ son, harry. but he couldn’t. he couldn’t kill that little boy. no one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill potter, voldemort’s power somehow broke that’s why he’s gone.” dumbledore nodded glumly. it’s true?” faltered professor mcgonagall. all he’s done ... all people he’s killed ... he couldn’t kill a little boy? it’s just astounding ... of all things to stop him . . . but how in name of heaven did survive?” can only guess,” said dumbledore. may never know.” professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket examined it. it was a very odd watch. it had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around edge. it must have made sense to dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket said, late. i suppose it was he who told you i’d be here, by way?” said professor mcgonagall. i don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” come to bring to his aunt uncle. they’re only family he has left now.” don’t mean you can’t mean people who live here?” cried professor mcgonagall, jumping to her feet pointing at number four. you can’t. i’ve been watching them all day. you couldn’t find two people who are less like us. they’ve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all way up street, screaming for sweets. come live here!” best place for him,” said dumbledore firmly. aunt uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. i’ve written them a letter.” letter?” repeated professor mcgonagall faintly, sitting back down on wall. dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? these people will never understand him! he’ll be famous a legend i wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as day in future there will be books written about every child in our world will know his name!” said dumbledore, looking very seriously over top of his half-moon glasses. would be enough to turn any boy’s head. famous before he can walk talk! famous for something he won’t even remember! can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” professor mcgonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, then said, yes, you’re right, of course. but how is boy getting here, dumbledore?” she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding underneath it. bringing him.” think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this?” would trust hagrid with my life,” said dumbledore. not saying his heart isn’t in right place,” said professor mcgonagall grudgingly, you can’t pretend he’s not careless. he does tend to what was that?” a low rumbling sound had broken silence around them. it grew steadily louder as they looked up down street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at sky a huge motorcycle fell out of air landed on road in front of them. if motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to man sitting astride it. he was almost twice as tall as a normal man at least five times as wide. he looked simply too big to be allowed, so wild long tangles of bushy black hair beard hid most of his face, he had hands size of trash can lids, his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. in his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. said dumbledore, sounding relieved. last. where did you get that motorcycle?” it, professor dumbledore, sir,” said giant, climbing carefully off motorcycle as he spoke. sirius black lent it to me. i’ve got him, sir.” problems, were there?” sir house was almost destroyed, but i got him out all right before muggles started swarmin’ around. he fell asleep as we was flyin’ over bristol.” dumbledore professor mcgonagall bent forward over bundle of blankets. inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. that where ?” whispered professor mcgonagall. said dumbledore. have that scar forever.” you do something about it, dumbledore?” if i could, i wouldn’t. scars can come in handy. i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of london underground. well give him here, hagrid we’d better get this over with.” dumbledore took in his arms turned toward dursleys’ house. i could i say good-bye to him, sir?” asked hagrid. he bent his great, shaggy head over gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. then, suddenly, hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. hissed professor mcgonagall, wake muggles!” sobbed hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief burying his face in it. i c-c- can’t stand it lily an’ james dead an’ poor little off ter live with muggles yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, hagrid, or we’ll be found,” professor mcgonagall whispered, patting hagrid gingerly on arm as dumbledore stepped over low garden wall walked to front door. he laid gently on doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside harry’s blankets, then came back to other two. for a full minute three of them stood looked at little bundle; hagrid’s shoulders shook, professor mcgonagall blinked furiously, twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out. said dumbledore finally, that. we’ve no business staying here. we may as well go join celebrations.” said hagrid in a very muffled voice, best get this bike away. g professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore, sir.” wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, hagrid swung himself onto motorcycle kicked engine into life; with a roar it rose into air off into night. shall see you soon, i expect, professor mcgonagall,” said dumbledore, nodding to her. professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply. dumbledore turned walked back down street. on corner he stopped took out silver put- outer. he clicked it once, twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange he could make out a tabby cat slinking around corner at other end of street. he could just see bundle of blankets on step of number four. luck, harry,” he murmured. he turned on his heel with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. a breeze ruffled neat hedges of privet drive, which lay silent tidy under inky sky, very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. one small hand closed on letter beside him he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by mrs. dursley’s scream as she opened front door to put out milk bottles, nor that he would spend next few weeks being prodded pinched by his cousin dudley. ... he couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over country were holding up their glasses saying in hushed voices: boy who lived!” vanashig glass nearly ten years had passed since dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all. sun rose on same tidy front gardens lit up brass number four on dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly same as it had been on night when mr. dursley had seen that fateful news report about owls. only photographs on mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby, now photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged kissed by his mother. room held no sign at all that another boy lived in house, too. yet was still there, asleep at moment, but not for long. his aunt petunia was awake it was her shrill voice that made first noise of day. get up! now!” woke with a start. his aunt rapped on door again. she screeched. heard her walking toward kitchen then sound of frying pan being put on stove. he rolled onto his back tried to remember dream he had been having. it had been a good one. there had been a flying motorcycle in it. he had a funny feeling he’d had same dream before. his aunt was back outside door. you up yet?” she demanded. said harry. get a move on, i want you to look after bacon. don’t you dare let it burn, i want everything perfect on duddy’s birthday.” groaned. did you say?” his aunt snapped through door. nothing ...” dudley’s birthday how could he have forgotten? got slowly out of bed started looking for socks. he found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. was used to spiders, because cupboard under stairs was full of them, that was where he slept. when he was dressed he went down hall into kitchen. table was almost hidden beneath all dudley’s birthday presents. it looked as though dudley had gotten new computer he wanted, not to mention second television racing bike. exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry, as dudley was very fat hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody. dudley’s favorite punching bag was harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. didn’t look it, but he was very fast. perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but had always been small skinny for his age. he looked even smaller skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley’s, dudley was about four times bigger than he was. had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, bright green eyes. he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all times dudley had punched him on nose. only thing liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. he had had it as long as he could remember, first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it. car crash when your parents died,” she had said. don’t ask questions.” don’t ask questions that was first rule for a quiet life with dursleys. uncle vernon entered kitchen as was turning over bacon. your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting. about once a week, uncle vernon looked over top of his newspaper shouted that needed a haircut. must have had more haircuts than rest of boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way all over place. was frying eggs by time dudley arrived in kitchen with his mother. dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon. he had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig. put plates of egg bacon on table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. his face fell. he said, looking up at his mother father. two less than last year.” you haven’t counted auntie marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from mommy daddy.” right, thirty-seven then,” said dudley, going red in face. harry, who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned table over. aunt petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. how’s that, popkin? two more presents. is that all right?” dudley thought for a moment. it looked like hard work. finally he said slowly, i’ll have thirty ... thirty ...” sweetums,” said aunt petunia. dudley sat down heavily grabbed nearest parcel. right then.” uncle vernon chuckled. tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. boy, dudley!” he ruffled dudley’s hair. at that moment telephone rang aunt petunia went to answer it while uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, a vcr. he was ripping paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from telephone looking both angry worried. news, vernon,” she said. figg’s broken her leg. she can’t take him.” she jerked her head in harry’s direction. dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but harry’s heart gave a leap. every year on dudley’s birthday, his parents took him a friend out for day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or movies. every year, was left behind with mrs. figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. hated it there. whole house smelled of cabbage mrs. figg made him look at photographs of all cats she’d ever owned. what?” said aunt petunia, looking furiously at as though he’d planned this. knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs. figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies, snowy, mr. paws, tufty again. could phone marge,” uncle vernon suggested. be silly, vernon, she hates boy.” dursleys often spoke about like this, as though he wasn’t there or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. about what’s-her-name, your friend yvonne?” vacation in majorca,” snapped aunt petunia. could just leave me here,” put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change maybe even have a go on dudley’s computer) . aunt petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. come back find house in ruins?” she snarled. won’t blow up house,” said harry, but they weren’t listening. suppose we could take him to zoo,” said aunt petunia slowly, \"... leave him in car. ...” cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. ...” dudley began to cry loudly. in fact, he wasn’t really crying it had been years since he’d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. duddydums, don’t cry, mummy won’t let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. ... don’t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!” dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. always sp- spoils everything!” he shot a nasty grin through gap in his mothers arms. just then, doorbell rang good lord, they’re here!” said aunt petunia frantically a moment later, dudley’s best friend, piers polkiss, walked in with his mother. piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. he was usually one who held people’s arms behind their backs while dudley hit them. dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. half an hour later, harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in back of dursleys’ car with piers dudley, on way to zoo for first time in his life. his aunt uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, uncle vernon had taken aside. warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to harry’s, warning you now, boy any funny business, anything at all you’ll be in that cupboard from now until christmas.” i’m not going to do anything,” said harry, but uncle vernon didn’t believe him. no one ever did. problem was, strange things often happened around it was just no good telling dursleys he didn’t make them happen. once, aunt petunia, tired of coming back from barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left hide that horrible scar.” dudley had laughed himself silly at harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes taped glasses. next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off. he had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly. another time, aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). harder she tried to pull it over his head, smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn’t fit harry. aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in wash and, to his great relief, wasn’t punished. on other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on roof of school kitchens. dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on chimney. dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry’s headmistress telling them had been climbing school buildings. but all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at uncle vernon through locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind big trash cans outside kitchen doors. supposed that wind must have caught him in mid-jump. but today, nothing was going to go wrong. it was even worth being with dudley piers to be spending day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or mrs. figg’s cabbage-smelling living room. while he drove, uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia. he liked to complain about things: people at work, harry, council, harry, bank, were just a few of his favorite subjects. this morning, it was motorcycles. \"... roaring along like maniacs, young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. had a dream about a motorcycle,” said harry, remembering suddenly. was flying.” uncle vernon nearly crashed into car in front. he turned right around in his seat yelled at harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: dont fly!” dudley piers sniggered. know they don’t,” said harry. was only a dream.” but he wished he hadn’t said anything. if there was one thing dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. it was a very sunny saturday zoo was crowded with families. dursleys bought dudley piers large chocolate ice creams at entrance then, because smiling lady in van had asked what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. it wasn’t bad, either, thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley, except that it wasn’t blond. had best morning he’d had in a long time. he was careful to walk a little way apart from dursleys so that dudley piers, who were starting to get bored with animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. they ate in zoo restaurant, when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, uncle vernon bought him another one was allowed to finish first. felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. after lunch they went to reptile house. it was cool dark in there, with lit windows all along walls. behind glass, all sorts of lizards snakes were crawling slithering over bits of wood stone. dudley piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras thick, man-crushing pythons. dudley quickly found largest snake in place. it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon’s car crushed it into a trash can but at moment it didn’t look in mood. in fact, it was fast asleep. dudley stood with his nose pressed against glass, staring at glistening brown coils. it move,” he whined at his father. uncle vernon tapped on glass, but snake didn’t budge. it again,” dudley ordered. uncle vernon rapped glass smartly with his knuckles, but snake just snoozed on. is boring,” dudley moaned. he shuffled away. moved in front of tank looked intently at snake. he wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on glass trying to disturb it all day long. it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on door to wake you up; at least he got to visit rest of house. snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry’s. it winked. stared. then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. they weren’t. he looked back at snake winked, too. snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon dudley, then raised its eyes to ceiling. it gave a look that said quite plainly: get that all time.” know,” murmured through glass, though he wasn’t sure snake could hear him. must be really annoying.” snake nodded vigorously. do you come from, anyway?” asked. snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to glass. peered at it. boa constrictor, brazil. it nice there?” boa constrictor jabbed its tail at sign again read on: this specimen was bred in zoo. i see so you’ve never been to brazil?” as snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind made both of them jump. mr. dursley! come look at this snake! you wont believe what it’s doing!” dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. of way, you,” he said, punching in ribs. caught by surprise, fell hard on concrete floor. what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second, piers dudley were leaning right up close to glass, next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. sat up gasped; glass front of boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto floor. people throughout reptile house screamed started running for exits. as snake slid swiftly past him, could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, here i come. ... thanksss, amigo.” keeper of reptile house was in shock. glass,” he kept saying, did glass go?” \" zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over over again. piers dudley could only gibber. as far as had seen, snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by time they were all back in uncle vernon’s car, dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. but worst of all, for at least, was piers calming down enough to say, was talking to it, weren’t you, harry?” uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of house before starting on harry. he was so angry he could hardly speak. he managed to say, cupboard stay no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, aunt petunia had to run get him a large brandy. lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. he didn’t know what time it was he couldn’t be sure dursleys were asleep yet. until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to kitchen for some food. he’d lived with dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby his parents had died in that car crash. he couldn’t remember being in car when his parents had died. sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light a burning pain on his forehead. this, he supposed, was crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all green light came from. he couldn’t remember his parents at all. his aunt uncle never spoke about them, of course he was forbidden to ask questions. there were no photographs of them in house. when he had been younger, had dreamed dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; dursleys were his only family. yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in street seemed to know him. very strange strangers they were, too. a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia dudley. after asking furiously if he knew man, aunt petunia had rushed them out of shop without buying anything. a wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in street other day then walked away without a word. weirdest thing about all these people was way they seemed to vanish second tried to get a closer look. at school, had no one. everybody knew that dudley’s gang hated that odd in his baggy old clothes broken glasses, nobody liked to disagree with dudley’s gang. letters from no one escape of brazilian boa constrictor earned his longest-ever punishment. by time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, summer holidays had started dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old mrs. figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches. was glad school was over, but there was no escaping dudley’s gang, who visited house every single day. piers, dennis, malcolm, gordon were all big stupid, but as dudley was biggest stupidest of lot, he was leader. rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley’s favorite sport: hunting. this was why spent as much time as possible out of house, wandering around thinking about end of holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. when september came he would be going off to secondary school and, for first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with dudley. dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon’s old private school, smeltings. piers polkiss was going there too. harry, on other hand, was going to stonewall high, local public school. dudley thought this was very funny. stuff people’s heads down toilet first day at stonewall,” he told harry. to come upstairs practice?” thanks,” said harry. poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick.” then he ran, before dudley could work out what he’d said. one day in july, aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform, leaving at mrs. figg’s. mrs. figg wasn’t as bad as usual. it turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. she let watch television gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years. that evening, dudley paraded around living room for family in his brand-new uniform. smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, flat straw hats called boaters. they also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while teachers weren’t looking. this was supposed to be good training for later life. as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers, uncle vernon said gruffly that it was proudest moment of his life. aunt petunia burst into tears said she couldn’t believe it was her ickle dudleykins, he looked so handsome grown-up. didn’t trust himself to speak. he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. k k k there was a horrible smell in kitchen next morning when went in for breakfast. it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in sink. he went to have a look. tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. this?” he asked aunt petunia. her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. new school uniform,” she said. looked in bowl again. he said, didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” be stupid,” snapped aunt petunia. dyeing some of dudley’s old things gray for you. it’ll look just like everyone else’s when i’ve finished.” seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. he sat down at table tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. dudley uncle vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of smell from harry’s new uniform. uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual dudley banged his smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on table. they heard click of mail slot flop of letters on doormat. mail, dudley,” said uncle vernon from behind his paper. get it.” mail, harry.” dudley get it.” him with your smelting stick, dudley.” dodged smelting stick went to get mail. three things lay on doormat: a postcard from uncle vernon’s sister marge, who was vacationing on isle of wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, a letter for harry. picked it up stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. no one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. who would? he had no friends, no other relatives he didn’t belong to library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: mr. h. cupboard under stairs privet drive little whinging surrey envelope was thick heavy, made of yellowish parchment, address was written in emerald- green ink. there was no stamp. turning envelope over, his hand trembling, saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, a snake surrounding a large letter h. up, boy!” shouted uncle vernon from kitchen. are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” he chuckled at his own joke. went back to kitchen, still staring at his letter. he handed uncle vernon bill postcard, sat down, slowly began to open yellow envelope. uncle vernon ripped open bill, snorted in disgust, flipped over postcard. ill,” he informed aunt petunia. a funny whelk ...” said dudley suddenly. harry’s got something!” was on point of unfolding his letter, which was written on same heavy parchment as envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon. mine\\” said harry, trying to snatch it back. be writing to you?” sneered uncle vernon, shaking letter open with one hand glancing at it. his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. it didn’t stop there. within seconds it was grayish white of old porridge. he gasped. dudley tried to grab letter to read it, but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach. aunt petunia took it curiously read first line. for a moment it looked as though she might faint. she clutched her throat made a choking noise. oh my goodness vernon!” they stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that dudley were still in room. dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. he gave his father a sharp tap on head with his smelting stick. want to read that letter,” he said loudly. want to read it,” said furiously, it’s mine.” out, both of you,” croaked uncle vernon, stuffing letter back inside its envelope. didn’t move. want my letter!” he shouted. me see it!” demanded dudley. roared uncle vernon, he took both dudley by scruffs of their necks threw them into hall, slamming kitchen door behind them. dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at keyhole; dudley won, so harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at crack between door floor. aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice, at address how could they possibly know where he sleeps? you don’t think they’re watching house?” spying might be following us,” muttered uncle vernon wildly. what should we do, vernon? should we write back? tell them we don’t want could see uncle vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up down kitchen. he said finally. we’ll ignore it. if they don’t get an answer. ... yes, that’s best ... we won’t do anything. ...” not having one in house, petunia! didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” that evening when he got back from work, uncle vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited in his cupboard. my letter?” said harry, moment uncle vernon had squeezed through door. writing to me?” one. it was addressed to you by mistake,” said uncle vernon shortly. have burned it.” was not a mistake,” said angrily, had my cupboard on it.” yelled uncle vernon, a couple of spiders fell from ceiling. he took a few deep breaths then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. yes, about this cupboard. your aunt i have been thinking ... you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into dudley’s second bedroom.” said harry. ask questions!” snapped his uncle. this stuff upstairs, now.” dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for uncle vernon aunt petunia, one for visitors (usually uncle vernon’s sister, marge), one where dudley slept, one where dudley kept all toys things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. it only took one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from cupboard to this room. he sat down on bed stared around him. nearly everything in here was broken. month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank dudley had once driven over next door neighbor’s dog; in corner was dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with end all bent because dudley had sat on it. other shelves were full of books. they were only things in room that looked as though they’d never been touched. from downstairs came sound of dudley bawling at his mother, don’t want him in there ... i need that room ... make him get out. ...” sighed stretched out on bed. yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. dudley was in shock. he’d screamed, whacked his father with his smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, thrown his tortoise through greenhouse roof, he still didn’t have his room back. was thinking about this time yesterday bitterly wishing he’d opened letter in hall. uncle vernon aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly. when mail arrived, uncle vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry, made dudley go get it. they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all way down hall. then he shouted, another one! h. potter, smallest bedroom, privet drive with a strangled cry, uncle vernon leapt from his seat ran down hall, right behind him. uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to ground to get letter from him, which was made difficult by fact that had grabbed uncle vernon around neck from behind. after a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by smelting stick, uncle vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with harry’s letter clutched in his hand. to your cupboard i mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at harry. go just go.” walked round round his new room. someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. surely that meant they’d try again? this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. he had a plan. repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock next morning. turned it off quickly dressed silently. he mustn’t wake dursleys. he stole downstairs without turning on any of lights. he was going to wait for postman on corner of privet drive get letters for number four first. his heart hammered as he crept across dark hall toward front door ! leapt into air; he’d trodden on something big squashy on doormat something alive\\ lights clicked on upstairs to his horror realized that big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. uncle vernon had been lying at foot of front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. he shouted at for about half an hour then told him to go make a cup of tea. shuffled miserably off into kitchen by time he got back, mail had arrived, right into uncle vernon’s lap. could see three letters addressed in green ink. want he began, but uncle vernon was tearing letters into pieces before his eyes. uncle vernon didn’t go to work that day. he stayed at home nailed up mail slot. he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails, they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.” not sure that’ll work, vernon.” these peoples minds work in strange ways, petunia, they’re not like you me,” said uncle vernon, trying to knock in a nail with piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him. on friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for harry. as they couldn’t go through mail slot they had been pushed under door, slotted through sides, a few even forced through small window in downstairs bathroom. uncle vernon stayed at home again. after burning all letters, he got out a hammer nails boarded up cracks around front back doors so no one could go out. he hummed through tulips” as he worked, jumped at small noises. on saturday, things began to get out of hand. twenty-four letters to found their way into house, rolled up hidden inside each of two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through living room window. while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to post office dairy trying to find someone to complain to, aunt petunia shredded letters in her food processor. on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” dudley asked in amazement. k k on sunday morning, uncle vernon sat down at breakfast table looking tired rather ill, but happy. post on sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, damn letters today something came whizzing down kitchen chimney as he spoke caught him sharply on back of head. next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of fireplace like bullets. dursleys ducked, but leapt into air trying to catch one out!” uncle vernon seized around waist threw him into hall. when aunt petunia dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, uncle vernon slammed door shut. they could hear letters still streaming into room, bouncing off walls floor. does it,” said uncle vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at same time. want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. we’re going away. just pack some clothes. no arguments!” he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through boarded-up doors were in car, speeding toward highway. dudley was sniffling in back seat; his father had hit him round head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, vcr, computer in his sports bag. they drove. they drove. even aunt petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. every now then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn drive in opposite direction for a while. off ... shake off,” he would mutter whenever he did this. they didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. by nightfall dudley was howling. he’d never had such a bad day in his life. he was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy- looking hotel on outskirts of a big city. dudley shared a room with twin beds damp, musty sheets. dudley snored but stayed awake, sitting on windowsill, staring down at lights of passing cars wondering... they ate stale cornflakes cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast next day. they had just finished when owner of hotel came over to their table. me, but is one of you mr. h. potter? only i got about an of these at front desk.” she held up a letter so they could read green ink address: mr. h. room railview hotel cokeworth made a grab for letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of way. woman stared. take them,” said uncle vernon, standing up quickly following her from dining room. k k it be better just to go home, dear?” aunt petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but uncle vernon didn’t seem to hear her. exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. he drove them into middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in car, off they went again. same thing happened in middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, at top of a multilevel parking garage. gone mad, hasn’t he?” dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon. uncle vernon had parked at coast, locked them all inside car, disappeared. it started to rain. great drops beat on roof of car. dudley sniveled. monday,” he told his mother. great humberto’s on tonight. i want to stay somewhere with a television.” monday. this reminded of something. if it was monday you could usually count on dudley to know days of week, because of television then tomorrow, tuesday, was harry’s eleventh birthday. of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun last year, dursleys had given him a coat hanger a pair of uncle vernon’s old socks. still, you weren’t eleven every day. uncle vernon was back he was smiling. he was also carrying a long, thin package didn’t answer aunt petunia when she asked what he’d bought. perfect place!” he said. on! everyone out!” it was very cold outside car. uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. perched on top of rock was most miserable little shack you could imagine. one thing was certain, there was no television in there. forecast for tonight!” said uncle vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!” a toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in iron-gray water below them. already got us some rations,” said uncle vernon, all aboard!” it was freezing in boat. icy sea spray rain crept down their necks a chilly wind whipped their faces. after what seemed like hours they reached rock, where uncle vernon, slipping sliding, led way to broken-down house. inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, wind whistled through gaps in wooden walls, fireplace was damp empty. there were only two rooms. uncle vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each four bananas. he tried to start a fire but empty chip bags just smoked shriveled up. do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully. he was in a very good mood. obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. privately agreed, though thought didn’t cheer him up at all. as night fell, promised storm blew up around them. spray from high waves splattered walls of hut a fierce wind rattled filthy windows. aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in second room made up a bed for dudley on moth-eaten sofa. she uncle vernon went off to lumpy bed next door, was left to find softest bit of floor he could to curl up under thinnest, most ragged blanket. storm raged more more ferociously as night went on. couldn’t sleep. he shivered turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. dudley’s snores were drowned by low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. lighted dial of dudley’s watch, which was dangling over edge of sofa on his fat wrist, told he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. he lay watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if dursleys would remember at all, wondering where letter writer was now. five minutes to go. heard something creak outside. he hoped roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. four minutes to go. maybe house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow. three minutes to go. was that sea, slapping hard on rock like that? (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? was rock crumbling into sea? one minute to go he’d be eleven. thirty seconds ... twenty ... ten ... nine maybe he’d wake dudley up, just to annoy him three ... two ... one ... boom. whole shack shivered sat bolt upright, staring at door. someone was outside, knocking to come in. keeper of keys boom. they knocked again. dudley jerked awake. cannon?” he said stupidly. there was a crash behind them uncle vernon came skidding into room. he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in long, thin package he had brought with them. there?” he shouted. warn you i’m armed!” there was a pause. then smash! door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges with a deafening crash landed flat on floor. a giant of a man was standing in doorway. his face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all hair. giant squeezed his way into hut, stooping so that his head just brushed ceiling. he bent down, picked up door, fitted it easily back into its frame. noise of storm outside dropped a little. he turned to look at them all. make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? it’s not been an easy journey. ...” he strode over to sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear. up, yeh great lump,” said stranger. dudley squeaked ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind uncle vernon. here’s harry!” said giant. looked up into fierce, wild, shadowy face saw that beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. time i saw you, you was only a baby,” said giant. look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.” uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise. demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. are breaking entering!” shut up, dursley, yeh great prune,” said giant; he reached over back of sofa, jerked gun out of uncle vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, threw it into a corner of room. uncle vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. harry,” said giant, turning his back on dursleys, very happy birthday to yeh. got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.” from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. opened it with trembling fingers. inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday written on it in green icing. looked up at giant. he meant to say thank you, but words got lost on way to his mouth, what he said instead was, are you?” giant chuckled. i haven’t introduced meself. rubeus hagrid, keeper of keys grounds at hogwarts.” he held out an enormous hand shook harry’s whole arm. about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.” his eyes fell on empty grate with shriveled chip bags in it he snorted. he bent down over fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. it filled whole damp hut with flickering light felt warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath. giant sat back down on sofa, which sagged under his weight, began taking all sorts of things out of pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. soon hut was full of sound smell of sizzling sausage. nobody said a thing while giant was working, but as he slid first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from poker, dudley fidgeted a little. uncle vernon said sharply, touch anything he gives you, dudley.” giant chuckled darkly. great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, dursley, don’ worry.” he passed sausages to harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off giant. finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, sorry, but i still don’t really know who you are.” giant took a gulp of tea wiped his mouth with back of his hand. me hagrid,” he said, does. an’ like i told yeh, i’m keeper of keys at hogwarts yeh’ll know all about hogwarts, o’ course.” no,” said harry. hagrid looked shocked. said quickly. barked hagrid, turning to stare at dursleys, who shrank back into shadows. them as should be sorry! i knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?” what?” asked harry. what?” hagrid thundered. wait jus’ one second!” he had leapt to his feet. in his anger he seemed to fill whole hut. dursleys were cowering against wall. you mean ter tell me,” he growled at dursleys, this boy this boy! knows nothin’ abou’ about anything?” thought this was going a bit far. he had been to school, after all, his marks weren’t bad. know some things,” he said. can, you know, do math stuff.” but hagrid simply waved his hand said, our world, i mean. your world. my world. yer parents’ world.” world?” hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. he boomed. uncle vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like hagrid stared wildly at harry. yeh must know about yer mom dad,” he said. mean, they’re famous. you’re famous.” my my mom dad weren’t famous, were they?” don’ know ... yeh don’ know ...” hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing with a bewildered stare. don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally. uncle vernon suddenly found his voice. he commanded. right there, sir! i forbid you to tell boy anything!” a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under furious look hagrid now gave him; when hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. never told him? never told him what was in letter dumbledore left fer him? i was there! i saw dumbledore leave it, dursley! an’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?” what from me?” said eagerly. i forbid you!” yelled uncle vernon in panic. aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror. go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said hagrid. yer a wizard.” there was silence inside hut. only sea whistling wind could be heard. a what?” gasped harry. wizard, o’ course,” said hagrid, sitting back down on sofa, which groaned sank even lower, a thumpin’ good’un, i’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. with a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? an’ i reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.” stretched out his hand at last to take yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to mr. h. potter, floor, hut-on-the-rock, sea. he pulled out letter read: hogwarts school o/witchcraft wizardry headmaster: albus dumbledore (order of merlin, first class, grand sore., chf. warlock, supreme mugwump, international confed. of wizards) dear mr. potter, we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft wizardry. please find enclosed a list of all necessary books equipment. term begins on september we await your owl by no later than july yours sincerely, minerva mcgonagall, deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harry’s head like fireworks he couldn’t decide which to ask first. after a few minutes he stammered, does it mean, they await my owl?” gorgons, that reminds me,” said hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl a long quill, a roll of parchment. with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that could read upside down: dear professor dumbledore, given his letter. taking him to buy his things tomorrow. weather’s horrible. hope you’re well. hagrid hagrid rolled up note, gave it to owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to door, threw owl out into storm. then he came back sat down as though this was as normal as talking on telephone. realized his mouth was open closed it quickly. was i?” said hagrid, but at that moment, uncle vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into firelight. not going,” he said. hagrid grunted. like ter see a great muggle like you stop him,” he said. what?” said harry, interested. muggle,” said hagrid, what we call nonmagic folk like them. an’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on.” swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said uncle vernon, we’d stamp it out of him! wizard indeed!” knew?” said harry. knew i’m a a wizard?” shrieked aunt petunia suddenly. of course we knew! how could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? oh, she got a letter just like that disappeared off to that that school came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. i was only one who saw her for what she was a freak! but for my mother father, oh no, it was lily this lily that, they were proud of having a witch in family!” she stopped to draw a deep breath then went ranting on. it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. she met that at school they left got married had you, of course i knew you’d be just same, just as strange, just as as abnormal then, if you please, she went got herself blown up we got landed with you!” had gone very white. as soon as he found his voice he said, up? you told me they died in a car crash!” crash!” roared hagrid, jumping up so angrily that dursleys scuttled back to their corner. could a car crash kill lily an’ james potter? it’s an outrage! a scandal! not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!” why? what happened?” asked urgently. anger faded from hagrid’s face. he looked suddenly anxious. never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. had no idea, when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. ah, harry, i don’ know if i’m right person ter tell yeh but someone’s gotta yeh can’t go off ter hogwarts not knowin’.” he threw a dirty look at dursleys. it’s best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh mind, i can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. ...” he sat down, stared into fire for a few seconds, then said, begins, i suppose, with with a person called but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows i don’ like sayin’ name if i can help it. no one does.” not?” gargoyles, harry, people are still scared. blimey, this is difficult. see, there was this wizard who went ... bad. as bad as you could go. worse. worse than worse. his name was ...” hagrid gulped, but no words came out. you write it down?” suggested. can’t spell it. all right voldemort.” hagrid shuddered. make me say it again. anyway, this this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. got too some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, he was gettin’ himself power, all right. dark days, harry. didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. he was takin’ over. some stood up to him an’ he killed horribly. one o’ only safe places left was hogwarts. reckon dumbledore’s only one you-know-who was afraid of. didn’t dare try takin’ school, not jus’ then, anyway. yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as i ever knew. head boy an’ girl at hogwarts in their day! suppose myst’ry is why you-know- who never tried to get on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with dark side. he thought he could persuade ... maybe he just wanted outta way. all anyone knows is, he turned up in village where you was all living, on halloween ten years ago. you was just a year old. he came ter yer house an’ an’ hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. he said. it’s that sad knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find anyway killed an’ then an’ this is real myst’ry of thing he tried to kill you, too. wanted ter make a clean job of it, i suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. but he couldn’t do it. never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? that was no ordinary cut. that’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, harry. no one ever lived after he decided ter kill no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ best witches an’ wizards of age mckinnons, bones, prewetts an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.” something very painful was going on in harry’s mind. as hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before he remembered something else, for first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. hagrid was watching him sadly. yeh from ruined house myself, on dumbledore’s orders. brought yeh ter this lot ...” of old tosh,” said uncle vernon. jumped; he had almost forgotten that dursleys were there. uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. he was glaring at hagrid his fists were clenched. you listen here, boy,” he snarled, accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, world’s better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end but at that moment, hagrid leapt from sofa drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword, he said, warning you, dursley i’m warning you one more word ...” in danger of being speared on end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, uncle vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against wall fell silent. better,” said hagrid, breathing heavily sitting back down on sofa, which this time sagged right down to floor. harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. what happened to vol-, sorry i mean, you- know-who?” question, harry. disappeared. vanished. same night he tried ter kill you. makes yeh even more famous. that’s biggest myst’ry, see ... he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful why’d he go? say he died. codswallop, in my opinion. dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but i don’ believe it. people who was on his side came back ter ours. some of came outta kinda trances. don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was cornin’ back. of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. too weak to carry on. somethin’ about you finished him, harry. there was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on dunno what it was, no one does but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.” hagrid looked at with warmth respect blazing in his eyes, but harry, instead of feeling pleased proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. a wizard? him? how could he possibly be? he’d spent his life being clouted by dudley, bullied by aunt petunia uncle vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? if he’d once defeated greatest sorcerer in world, how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? he said quietly, think you must have made a mistake. i don’t think i can be a wizard.” to his surprise, hagrid chuckled. a wizard, eh? never made things happen when you was scared or angry?” looked into fire. now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt uncle furious with him had happened when he, harry, had been upset or angry ... chased by dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . very last time dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? looked back at hagrid, smiling, saw that hagrid was positively beaming at him. said hagrid. potter, not a wizard you wait, you’ll be right famous at hogwarts.” but uncle vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight. i told you he’s not going?” he hissed. going to stonewall high he’ll be grateful for it. i’ve read those letters he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books wands he wants ter go, a great muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled hagrid. lily an’ james potter’s son goin’ ter hogwarts! yer mad. his name’s been down ever since he was born. he’s off ter finest school of witchcraft wizardry in world. seven years there he won’t know himself. he’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had, albus dumbled am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!” yelled uncle vernon. but he had finally gone too far. hagrid seized his umbrella whirled it over his head, he thundered, insult albus dumbledore in front of me!” he brought umbrella swishing down through air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, next second, dudley was dancing on spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. when he turned his back on them, saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. uncle vernon roared. pulling aunt petunia dudley into other room, he cast one last terrified look at hagrid slammed door behind them. hagrid looked down at his umbrella stroked his beard. lost me temper,” he said ruefully, it didn’t work anyway. meant ter turn him into a pig, but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” he cast a sideways look at under his bushy eyebrows. grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at hogwarts,” he said. er not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff one o’ reasons i was so keen ter take on job aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked harry. well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled, ter tell yeh truth. in me third year. they snapped me wand in half an’ everything. but dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. great man, dumbledore.” were you expelled?” gettin’ late we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said hagrid loudly. get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.” he took off his thick black coat threw it to harry. can kip under that,” he said. mind if it wriggles a bit, i think i still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ pockets.” diagon ally woke early next morning. although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. was a dream,” he told himself firmly. dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for wizards. when i open my eyes i’ll be at home in my cupboard.” there was suddenly a loud tapping noise. there’s aunt petunia knocking on door, thought, his heart sinking. but he still didn’t open his eyes. it had been such a good dream. tap. tap. tap. right,” mumbled, getting up.” he sat up hagrid heavy coat fell off him. hut was full of sunlight, storm was over, hagrid himself was asleep on collapsed sofa, there was an owl rapping its claw on window, a newspaper held in its beak. scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. he went straight to window jerked it open. owl swooped in dropped newspaper on top of hagrid, who didn’t wake up. owl then fluttered onto floor began to attack hagrid coat. do that.” tried to wave owl out of way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him carried on savaging coat. said loudly. an owl him,” hagrid grunted into sofa. wants payin’ fer deliverin’ paper. look in pockets.” hagrid coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags ... finally, pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. him five knuts,” said hagrid sleepily. little bronze ones.” counted out five little bronze coins, owl held out his leg so could put money into a small leather pouch tied to it. then he flew off through open window. hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, stretched. be off, harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter london an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.” was turning over wizard coins looking at them. he had just thought of something that made him feel as though happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. hagrid?” said hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. haven’t got any money you heard uncle vernon last night ... he won’t pay for me to go learn magic.” worry about that,” said hagrid, standing up scratching his head. think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?” if their house was destroyed didn’ keep their gold in house, boy! nah, first stop fer us is gringotts. wizards’ bank. have a sausage, they’re not bad cold an’ i wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” have banks?” one. gringotts. run by goblins.” dropped bit of sausage he was holding. so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, i’ll tell yeh that. never mess with goblins, harry. gringotts is safest place in world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe maybe hogwarts. as a matter o’ fact, i gotta visit gringotts anyway fer dumbledore. hogwarts business.” hagrid drew himself up proudly. usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. fetchin’ you gettin’ things from gringotts knows he can trust me, see. everythin’? come on, then.” followed hagrid out onto rock. sky was quite clear now sea gleamed in sunlight. boat uncle vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in bottom after storm. did you get here?” asked, looking around for another boat. said hagrid. but we’ll go back in this. not s’pposed ter use magic now i’ve got yeh.” they settled down in boat, still staring at hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. a shame ter row, though,” said hagrid, giving another of his sideways looks. i was ter er speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at hogwarts?” course not,” said harry, eager to see more magic. hagrid pulled out pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on side of boat, they sped off toward land. would you be mad to try rob gringotts?” asked. enchantments,” said hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. say there’s dragons guardin’ high-security vaults. then yeh gotta find yer way gringotts is hundreds of miles under london, see. deep under underground. yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” sat thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper, daily prophet had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life. o’ magic messin’ things up as usual,” hagrid muttered, turning page. a ministry of magic?” asked, before he could stop himself. said hagrid. wanted dumbledore fer minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave hogwarts, so old cornelius fudge got job. bungler if ever there was one. so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” what does a ministry of magic do?” their main job is to keep it from muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down country.” blimey, harry, everyone be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. nah, we’re best left alone.” at this moment boat bumped gently into harbor wall. hagrid folded up his newspaper, they clambered up steps onto street. passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through little town to station. couldn’t blame them. not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters saying loudly, that, harry? things these muggles dream up, eh?” said harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, you say there are dragons at gringotts?” so they say,” said hagrid. i’d like a dragon.” like one?” one ever since i was a kid here we go.” they had reached station. there was a train to london in five minutes’ time. hagrid, who didn’t understand money,” as he called it, gave bills to so he could buy their tickets. people stared more than ever on train. hagrid took up two seats sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. got yer letter, harry?” he asked as he counted stitches. took parchment envelope out of his pocket. said hagrid. a list there of everything yeh need.” unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed night before, read: hogwarts school o/witchcraft wizardry uniform first-year students will require: . three sets of plain work robes (black) one plain pointed hat (black) for day wear one pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) one winter cloak

set glass or crystal phials telescope set brass scales students may also bring an owl or a cat or a toad parents are reminded that first years are not allowed their own broomsticks we buy all this in london?” wondered aloud. yeh know where to go,” said hagrid. had never been to london before. although hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. he got stuck in ticket barrier on underground, complained loudly that seats were too small trains too slow. don’t know how muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. hagrid was so huge that he parted crowd easily; all had to do was keep close behind him. they passed book shops music stores, hamburger restaurants cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? were there really shops that sold spell books broomsticks? might this not all be some huge joke that dursleys had cooked up? if hadn’t known that dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, couldn’t help trusting him. is it,” said hagrid, coming to a halt, leaky cauldron. it’s a famous place.” it was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. if hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, wouldn’t have noticed it was there. people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. their eyes slid from big book shop on one side to record shop on other as if they couldn’t see leaky cauldron at all. in fact, had most peculiar feeling that only he hagrid could see it. before he could mention this, hagrid had steered him inside. for a famous place, it was very dark shabby. a few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. one of them was smoking a long pipe. a little man in a top hat was talking to old bartender, who was quite bald looked like a toothless walnut. low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. everyone seemed to know hagrid; they waved smiled at him, bartender reached for a glass, saying, usual, hagrid?” tom, i’m on hogwarts business,” said hagrid, clapping his great hand on harry’s shoulder making harry’s knees buckle. lord,” said bartender, peering at harry, this can this be ?” leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still silent. my soul,” whispered old bartender, ... what an honor.” he hurried out from behind bar, rushed toward seized his hand, tears in his eyes. back, mr. potter, welcome back.” didn’t know what to say. everyone was looking at him. old woman with pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. hagrid was beaming. then there was a great scraping of chairs next moment, found himself shaking hands with everyone in leaky cauldron. crockford, mr. potter, can’t believe i’m meeting you at last.” proud, mr. potter, i’m just so proud.” wanted to shake your hand i’m all of a flutter.” mr. potter, just can’t tell you, diggle’s name, dedalus diggle.” seen you before!” said harry, as dedalus diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. bowed to me once in a shop.” remembers!” cried dedalus diggle, looking around at everyone. you hear that? he remembers me!” shook hands again again doris crockford kept coming back for more. a pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. one of his eyes was twitching. quirrell!” said hagrid. professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwarts.” stammered professor quirrell, grasping harry’s hand, t-tell you how p-pleased i am to meet you.” sort of magic do you teach, professor quirrell?” against d-d-dark arts,” muttered professor quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. that you n-need it, eh, p-p-potter?” he laughed nervously. be g-getting all your equipment, i suppose? i’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b- book on vampires, m-myself.” he looked terrified at very thought. but others wouldn’t let professor quirrell keep to himself. it took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. at last, hagrid managed to make himself heard over babble. get on lots ter buy. come on, harry.” doris crockford shook harry’s hand one last time, hagrid led them through bar out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can a few weeds. hagrid grinned at harry. yeh, didn’t i? told yeh you was famous. even professor quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.” he always that nervous?” yeah. poor bloke. brilliant mind. he was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. ... they say he met vampires in black forest, there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag never been same since. scared of students, scared of his own subject now, where’s me umbrella?” vampires? hags? harry’s head was swimming. hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in wall above trash can. up ... two across ...” he muttered. stand back, harry.” he tapped wall three times with point of his umbrella. brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in middle, a small hole appeared it grew wider wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted turned out of sight. said hagrid, diagon alley.” he grinned at harry’s amazement. they stepped through archway. looked quickly over his shoulder saw archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside nearest shop. cauldrons all sizes copper, brass, pewter, silver self-stirring collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. you’ll be needin’ one,” said hagrid, we gotta get yer money first.” wished he had about eight more eyes. he turned his head in every direction as they walked up street, trying to look at everything at once: shops, things outside them, people doing their shopping. a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, liver, sixteen sickles an ounce, they’re mad.” a low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny, screech, barn, brown, snowy. several boys of about harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. heard one of them say, new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes strange silver instruments had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of moon. ... said hagrid. they had reached a snowy white building that towered over other little shops. standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet gold, was that’s a goblin,” said hagrid quietly as they walked up white steps toward him. goblin was about a head shorter than harry. he had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, noticed, very long fingers feet. he bowed as they walked inside. now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: enter, stranger, but take heed of what awaits sin of greed, for those who take, but do not earn, must pay most dearly in their turn. so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours, thief, you have been warned, beware of finding more than treasure there. i said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said hagrid. a pair of goblins bowed them through silver doors they were in a vast marble hall. about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. there were too many doors to count leading off hall, yet more goblins were showing people in out of these. hagrid made for counter. said hagrid to a free goblin. come ter take some money outta mr. potter’s safe.” have his key, sir?” it here somewhere,” said hagrid, he started emptying his pockets onto counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over goblins book of numbers. goblin wrinkled his nose. watched goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. it,” said hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. goblin looked at it closely. seems to be in order.” i’ve also got a letter here from professor dumbledore,” said hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. about you-know-what in vault seven hundred thirteen.” goblin read letter carefully. well,” he said, handing it back to hagrid, will have someone take you down to both vaults. griphook!” griphook was yet another goblin. once hagrid had crammed all dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he followed griphook toward one of doors leading off hall. you-know-what in vault seven hundred thirteen?” asked. tell yeh that,” said hagrid mysteriously. secret. hogwarts business. dumbledore’s trusted me. more’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.” griphook held door open for them. harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. they were in a narrow passageway lit with flaming torches. it sloped steeply downward there were little railway tracks on floor. griphook whistled a small cart came hurtling up tracks toward them. they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty were off. at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because griphook wasn’t steering. harry’s eyes stung as cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at end of a passage twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites stalagmites grew from ceiling floor. never know,” called to hagrid over noise of cart, difference between a stalagmite a stalactite?” got an in it,” said hagrid. don’ ask me questions just now, i think i’m gonna be sick.” he did look very green, when cart stopped at last beside a small door in passage wall, hagrid got out had to lean against wall to stop his knees from trembling. griphook unlocked door. a lot of green smoke came billowing out, as it cleared, gasped. inside were mounds of gold coins. columns of silver. heaps of little bronze knuts. yours,” smiled hagrid. all harry’s it was incredible. dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. how often had they complained how much cost them to keep? all time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under london. hagrid helped pile some of it into a bag. gold ones are galleons,” he explained. silver sickles to a galleon twenty-nine knuts to a sickle, it’s easy enough. right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep rest safe for yeh.” he turned to griphook. seven hundred thirteen now, please, can we go more slowly?” speed only,” said griphook. they were going even deeper now gathering speed. air became colder colder as they hurtled round tight corners. they went rattling over an underground ravine, leaned over side to try to see what was down at dark bottom, but hagrid groaned pulled him back by scruff of his neck. vault seven hundred thirteen had no keyhole. back,” said griphook importantly. he stroked door gently with one of his long fingers it simply melted away. anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through door trapped in there,” said griphook. often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” asked. once every ten years,” said griphook with a rather nasty grin. something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, was sure, he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at very least but at first he thought it was empty. then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on floor. hagrid picked it up tucked it deep inside his coat. longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. on, back in this infernal cart, don’t talk to me on way back, it’s best if i keep me mouth shut,” said hagrid. one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in sunlight outside gringotts. didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. he didn’t have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had. as well get yer uniform,” said hagrid, nodding toward madam malkin’s robes for all occasions. harry, would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick-me-up in leaky cauldron? i hate them gringotts carts.” he did still look a bit sick, so entered madam malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. madam malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. dear?” she said, when started to speak. lot here another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.” in back of shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. madam malkin stood on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, began to pin it to right length. said boy, too?” said harry. father’s next door buying my books mother’s up street looking at wands,” said boy. he had a bored, drawling voice. i’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. i don’t see why first years can’t have their own. i think i’ll bully father into getting me one i’ll smuggle it in somehow.” was strongly reminded of dudley. you got your own broom?” boy went on. said harry. quidditch at all?” said again, wondering what on earth quidditch could be. i do father says it’s a crime if i’m not picked to play for my house, i must say, i agree. know what house you be in yet?” said harry, feeling more stupid by minute. no one really knows until they get there, do they, but i know i’ll be in slytherin, all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff, i think i’d leave, wouldn’t you?” said harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. say, look at that man!” said boy suddenly, nodding toward front window. hagrid was standing there, grinning at pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. hagrid,” said harry, pleased to know something boy didn’t. works at hogwarts.” said boy, heard of him. he’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?” gamekeeper,” said harry. he was liking boy less less every second. exactly. i heard he’s a sort of savage lives in a hut on school grounds every now then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, ends up setting fire to his bed.” think he’s brilliant,” said coldly. you?” said boy, with a slight sneer. is he with you? where are your parents?” dead,” said shortly. he didn’t feel much like going into matter with this boy. sorry,” said other, not sounding sorry at all. they were our kind, weren’t they?” were a witch wizard, if that’s what you mean.” really don’t think they should let other sort in, do you? they’re just not same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get letter, imagine. i think they should keep it in old wizarding families. what’s your surname, anyway?” but before could answer, madam malkin said, you done, my dear,” harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to boy, hopped down from footstool. i’ll see you at hogwarts, i suppose,” said drawling boy. was rather quiet as he ate ice cream hagrid had bought him (chocolate raspberry with chopped nuts). up?” said hagrid. lied. they stopped to buy parchment quills. cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. when they had left shop, he said, what’s quidditch?” harry, i keep forgettin’ how little yeh know not knowin’ about quidditch!” make me feel worse,” said harry. he told hagrid about pale boy in madam malkin’s. he said people from muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in not from a muggle family. if he’d known who yeh were he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. you saw what everyone in leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh. anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ best i ever saw were only ones with magic in in a long line o’ muggles look at yer mum! look what she had fer a sister!” what is quidditch?” our sport. wizard sport. it’s like like soccer in muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in air on broomsticks there’s four balls sorta hard ter explain rules.” what are slytherin hufflepuff?” houses. there’s four. everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but bet i’m in hufflepuff,” said gloomily. hufflepuff than slytherin,” said hagrid darkly. not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in slytherin. you-know-who was one.” sorry you-know-who was at hogwarts?” an’ years ago,” said hagrid. they bought harry’s school books in a shop called flourish blotts where shelves were stacked to ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols a few books with nothing in them at all. even dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. hagrid almost had to drag away from curses counter-curses (bewitch your friends befuddle your enemies with latest revenges: hair loss, jelly-legs, tongue-tying much, much more) by professor vindictus viridian. was trying to find out how to curse dudley.” not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said hagrid. anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” hagrid wouldn’t let buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“it says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients a collapsible brass telescope. then they visited apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs rotted cabbages. barrels of slimy stuff stood on floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, bright powders lined walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, snarled claws hung from ceiling. while hagrid asked man behind counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry, himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one galleons each minuscule, glittery- black beetle eyes (five knuts a scoop). outside apothecary, hagrid checked harry’s list again. yer wand left oh yeah, an’ i still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” felt himself go red. don’t have to know i don’t have to. tell yeh what, i’ll get yer animal. not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at an’ i don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. i’ll get yer an owl. all kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.” twenty minutes later, they left eeylops owl emporium, which had been dark full of rustling flickering, jewel-bright eyes. now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. he couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like professor quirrell. mention it,” said hagrid gruffly. expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them dursleys. just ollivanders left now only place fer wands, ollivanders, yeh gotta have best wand.” a magic wand . . . this was what had been really looking forward to. last shop was narrow shabby. peeling gold letters over door read ollivanders: makers of fine wands since c. a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in dusty window. a tinkling bell rang somewhere in depths of shop as they stepped inside. it was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait. felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him looked instead at thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to ceiling. for some reason, back of his neck prickled. very dust silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. afternoon,” said a soft voice. jumped. hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise he got quickly off spindly chair. an old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through gloom of shop. said awkwardly. yes,” said man. yes. i thought i’d be seeing you soon. potter.” it wasn’t a question. have your mother’s eyes. it seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. ten a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. nice wand for charm work.” mr. ollivander moved closer to harry. wished he would blink. those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. father, on other hand, favored a mahogany wand. eleven inches. pliable. a little more power excellent for transfiguration. well, i say your father favored it it’s really wand that chooses wizard, of course.” mr. ollivander had come so close that he were almost nose to nose. could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. that’s where ...” mr. ollivander touched lightning scar on harry’s forehead with a long, white finger. sorry to say i sold wand that did it,” he said softly. inches. yew. powerful wand, very powerful, in wrong hands ... well, if i’d known what that wand was going out into world to do. ...” he shook his head then, to harry’s relief, spotted hagrid. rubeus hagrid! how nice to see you again. ... oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” was, sir, yes,” said hagrid. wand, that one. but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?” said mr. ollivander, suddenly stern. yes, they did, yes,” said hagrid, shuffling his feet. still got pieces, though,” he added brightly. you don’t use them?” said mr. ollivander sharply. no, sir,” said hagrid quickly. noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. said mr. ollivander, giving hagrid a piercing look. now mr. potter. let me see.” he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. is your wand arm?” well, i’m right-handed,” said harry. out your arm. that’s it.” he measured from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit round his head. as he measured, he said, ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, mr. potter. we use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, heartstrings of dragons. no two ollivander wands are same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite same. of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” suddenly realized that tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. mr. ollivander was flitting around shelves, taking down boxes. will do,” he said, tape measure crumpled into a heap on floor. then, mr. potter. try this one. beech-wood dragon heartstring. nine inches. nice flexible. just take it give it a wave.” took wand (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but mr. ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. phoenix feather. seven inches. quite whippy. try tried but he had hardly raised wand when it, too, was snatched back by mr. ollivander. no here, ebony unicorn hair, eight a half inches, springy. go on, go on, try it out.” tried. tried. he had no idea what mr. ollivander was waiting for. pile of tried wands was mounting higher higher on spindly chair, but more wands mr. ollivander pulled from shelves, happier he seemed to become. customer, eh? not to worry, well find perfect match here somewhere i wonder, now yes, why not unusual combination holly phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice supple.” took wand. he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. he raised wand above his head, brought it swishing down through dusty air a stream of red gold sparks shot from end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to walls. hagrid whooped clapped mr. ollivander cried, bravo! yes, indeed, oh, very good. well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...” he put harry’s wand back into its box wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, . . . curious said harry, what’s curious?” mr. ollivander fixed with his pale stare. remember every wand i’ve ever sold, mr. potter. every single wand. it so happens that phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather just one other. it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.” swallowed. thirteen-and-a-half inches. yew. curious indeed how these things happen. wand chooses wizard, remember. ... i think we must expect great things from you, mr. potter. ... after all, he-who- must-not-be-named did great things terrible, yes, but great.” shivered. he wasn’t sure he liked mr. ollivander too much. he paid seven gold galleons for his wand, mr. ollivander bowed them from his shop. late afternoon sun hung low in sky as hagrid made their way back down diagon alley, back through wall, back through leaky cauldron, now empty. didn’t speak at all as they walked down road; he didn’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on underground, laden as they were with all their funny- shaped packages, with snowy owl asleep in its cage on harry’s lap. up another escalator, out into paddington station; only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on shoulder. time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said. he bought a hamburger they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. kept looking around. everything looked so strange, somehow. all right, harry? yer very quiet,” said hagrid. wasn’t sure he could explain. he’d just had best birthday of his life yet he chewed his hamburger, trying to find words. thinks i’m special,” he said at last. those people in leaky cauldron, professor quirrell, mr. ollivander ... but i don’t know anything about magic at all. how can they expect great things? i’m famous i can’t even remember what i’m famous for. i don’t know what happened when vol-, sorry i mean, night my parents died.” hagrid leaned across table. behind wild beard eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. you worry, harry. you’ll learn fast enough. everyone starts at beginning at hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. just be yerself. i know it’s hard. yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. but yeh’ll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do, of fact.” hagrid helped on to train that would take him back to dursleys, then handed him an envelope. ticket fer hogwarts,” he said. o’ september king’s cross it’s all on yer ticket. any problems with dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. ... see yeh soon, harry.” train pulled out of station. wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat pressed his nose against window, but he blinked hagrid had gone. journey from platform nine three-quarters harry’s last month with dursleys wasn’t fun. true, dudley was now so scared of he wouldn’t stay in same room, while aunt petunia uncle vernon didn’t shut in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with in it were empty. although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. kept to his room, with his new owl for company. he had decided to call her hedwig, a name he had found in a history of magic. his school books were very interesting. he lay on his bed reading late into night, hedwig swooping in out of open window as she pleased. it was lucky that aunt petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore, because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. every night before he went to sleep, ticked off another day on piece of paper he had pinned to wall, counting down to september first. on last day of august he thought he’d better speak to his aunt uncle about getting to king’s cross station next day, so he went down to living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. he cleared his throat to let them know he was there, dudley screamed ran from room. uncle vernon?” uncle vernon grunted to show he was listening. i need to be at king’s cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts.” uncle vernon grunted again. it be all right if you gave me a lift?” grunt. supposed that meant yes. you.” he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke. way to get to a wizards’ school, train. magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” didn’t say anything. is this school, anyway?” don’t know,” said harry, realizing this for first time. he pulled ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket. just take train from platform nine three- quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read. his aunt uncle stared. what?” three-quarters.” talk rubbish,” said uncle vernon. is no platform nine three-quarters.” on my ticket.” said uncle vernon, mad, lot of them. you see. you just wait. all right, we’ll take you to king’s cross. we’re going up to london tomorrow anyway, or i wouldn’t bother.” are you going to london?” asked, trying to keep things friendly. dudley to hospital,” growled uncle vernon. to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltings.” woke at five o’clock next morning was too excited nervous to go back to sleep. he got up pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into station in his wizard’s robes he’d change on train. he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage, then paced room, waiting for dursleys to get up. two hours later, harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into dursleys’ car, aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry, they had set off. they reached king’s cross at half past ten. uncle vernon dumped harry’s trunk onto a cart wheeled it into station for him. thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead, facing platforms with a nasty grin on his face. there you are, boy. platform nine platform ten. your platform should be somewhere in middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?” he was quite right, of course. there was a big plastic number nine over one platform a big plastic number ten over one next to it, in middle, nothing at all. a good term,” said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile. he left without another word. turned saw dursleys drive away. all three of them were laughing. harry’s mouth went rather dry. what on earth was he going to do? he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of hedwig. he’d have to ask someone. he stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine three-quarters. guard had never heard of hogwarts when couldn’t even tell him what part of country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though was being stupid on purpose. getting desperate, asked for train that left at eleven o’clock, but guard said there wasn’t one. in end guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. was now trying hard not to panic. according to large clock over arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on train to hogwarts he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, a large owl. hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping third brick on left to get into diagon alley. he wondered if he should get out his wand start tapping ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine ten. at that moment a group of people passed just behind him he caught a few words of what they were saying. packed with muggles, of course swung round. speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. each of them was pushing a trunk like harry’s in front of him they had an owl. heart hammering, pushed his cart after them. they stopped so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. what’s platform number?” said boys’ mother. three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red- headed, who was holding her hand, can’t i go not old enough, ginny, now be quiet. all right, percy, you go first.” what looked like oldest boy marched toward platforms nine ten. watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as boy reached dividing barrier between two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him by time last backpack had cleared away, boy had vanished. you next,” plump woman said. not fred, i’m george,” said boy. woman, you call yourself our mother? can’t you tell i’m george?” george, dear.” joking, i am fred,” said boy, off he went. his twin called after him to hurry up, he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone but how had he done it? now third brother was walking briskly toward barrier he was almost there then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. there was nothing else for it. me,” said to plump woman. dear,” she said. time at hogwarts? ron’s new, too.” she pointed at last youngest of her sons. he was tall, thin, gangling, with freckles, big hands feet, a long nose. said harry. thing is thing is, i don’t know how to to get onto platform?” she said kindly, nodded. to worry,” she said. you have to do is walk straight at barrier between platforms nine ten. don’t stop don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. go on, go now before ron.” okay,” said harry. he pushed his trolley around stared at barrier. it looked very solid. he started to walk toward it. people jostled him on their way to platforms nine ten. walked more quickly. he was going to smash right into that barrier then he’d be in trouble leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run barrier was coming nearer nearer he wouldn’t be able to stop cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for crash it didn’t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his eyes. a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. a sign overhead said hogwarts express, eleven o’clock. looked behind him saw a wrought-iron archway where barrier had been, with words platform nine three- quarters on it. he had done it. smoke from engine drifted over heads of chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here there between their legs. owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over babble scraping of heavy trunks. first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. pushed his cart off down platform in search of an empty seat. he passed a round-faced boy who was saying, i’ve lost my toad again.” neville,” he heard old woman sigh. a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. us a look, lee, go on.” boy lifted lid of a box in his arms, people around him shrieked yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. pressed on through crowd until he found an empty compartment near end of train. he put hedwig inside first then started to shove heave his trunk toward train door. he tried to lift it up steps but could hardly raise one end twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. a hand?” it was one of red-haired twins he’d followed through barrier. please,” panted. fred! c’mere help!” with twins’ help, harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of compartment. said harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. that?” said one of twins suddenly, pointing at harry’s lightning scar. said other twin. you ?” is,” said first twin. you?” he added to harry. said harry. potter,” chorused twins. him,” said harry. mean, yes, i am.” two boys gawked at him, felt himself turning red. then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through train’s open door. george? are you there?” mom.” with a last look at harry, twins hopped off train. sat down next to window where, half hidden, he could watch red-haired family on platform hear what they were saying. their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. you’ve got something on your nose.” youngest boy tried to jerk out of way, but she grabbed him began rubbing end of his nose. geroff.” he wriggled free. has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of twins. up,” said ron. percy?” said their mother. coming now.” oldest boy came striding into sight. he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes, noticed a shiny red gold badge on his chest with letter p on it. stay long, mother,” he said. up front, prefects have got two compartments to themselves are you a prefect, percy?” said one of twins, with an air of great surprise. should have said something, we had no idea.” on, i think i remember him saying something about it,” said other twin. twice minute summer shut up,” said percy prefect. come percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of twins. he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. right, dear, well, have a good term send me an owl when you get there.” she kissed percy on cheek he left. then she turned to twins. you two this year, you behave yourselves. if i get one more owl telling me you’ve you’ve blown up a toilet or up a toilet? we’ve never blown up a toilet.” idea though, thanks, mom.” not funny. look after ron.” worry, ickle ronniekins is safe with us.” up,” said ron again. he was almost as tall as twins already his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. mom, guess what? guess who we just met on train?” leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking. know that black-haired boy who was near us in station? know who he is?” potted” heard little girl’s voice. mom, can i go on train see him, mom, oh please. ...” already seen him, ginny, poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. is he really, fred? how do you know?” him. saw his scar. it’s really there like lightning.” dear no wonder he was alone, i wondered. he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto platform.” mind that, do you think he remembers what you-know-who looks like?” their mother suddenly became very stern. forbid you to ask him, fred. no, don’t you dare. as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.” right, keep your hair on.” a whistle sounded. up!” their mother said, three boys clambered onto train. they leaned out of window for her to kiss them good-bye, their younger sister began to cry. ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” send you a hogwarts toilet seat.” georg e\\” joking, mom.” train began to move. saw boys’ mother waving their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back waved. watched girl her mother disappear as train rounded corner. houses flashed past window. felt a great leap of excitement. he didn’t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. door of compartment slid open youngest redheaded boy came in. sitting there?” he asked, pointing at seat opposite harry. else is full.” shook his head boy sat down. he glanced at then looked quickly out of window, pretending he hadn’t looked. saw he still had a black mark on his nose. ron.” twins were back. we’re going down middle of train lee jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” mumbled ron. said other twin, we introduce ourselves? fred george weasley. this is ron, our brother. see you later, then.” said ron. twins slid compartment door shut behind them. you really potter?” ron blurted out. nodded. well, i thought it might be one of fred george’s jokes,” said ron. have you really got you know ...” he pointed at harry’s forehead. pulled back his bangs to show lightning scar. ron stared. that’s where you-know-who ?” said harry, i can’t remember it.” said ron eagerly. i remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” said ron. he sat stared at for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of window again. all your family wizards?” asked harry, who found ron just as interesting as ron found him. yes, i think so,” said ron. think mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.” you must know loads of magic already.” weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families pale boy in diagon alley had talked about. heard you went to live with muggles,” said ron. are they like?” well, not all of them. my aunt uncle cousin are, though. wish i’d had three wizard brothers.” said ron. for some reason, he was looking gloomy. sixth in our family to go to hogwarts. you could say i’ve got a lot to live up to. bill charlie have already left bill was head boy charlie was captain of quidditch. now percy’s a prefect. fred george mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks everyone thinks they’re really funny. everyone expects me to do as well as others, but if i do, it’s no big deal, because they did it first. you never get anything new, either, with five brothers. i’ve got bill’s old robes, charlie’s old wand, percy’s old rat.” ron reached inside his jacket pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. name’s scabbers he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn’t aff i mean, i got scabbers instead.” ron’s ears went pink. he seemed to think he’d said too much, because he went back to staring out of window. didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. after all, he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago, he told ron so, all about having to wear dudley’s old clothes never getting proper birthday presents. this seemed to cheer ron up. \"... until hagrid told me, i didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped. said harry. you said you-know-who’s name\\” said ron, sounding both shocked impressed. have thought you, of all people not trying to be brave or anything, saying name,” said harry, just never knew you shouldn’t. see what i mean? i’ve got loads to learn. ... i bet,” he added, voicing for first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, bet i’m worst in class.” won’t be. there’s loads of people who come from muggle families they learn quick enough.” while they had been talking, train had carried them out of london. now they were speeding past fields full of cows sheep. they were quiet for a time, watching fields lanes flick past. around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in corridor a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door said, off cart, dears?” harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but ron’s ears went pink again he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. went out into corridor. he had never had any money for candy with dursleys, now that he had pockets rattling with gold silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but woman didn’t have mars bars. what she did have were bertie bott’s every flavor beans, drooble’s best blowing gum, chocolate frogs, pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, licorice wands, a number of other strange things had never seen in his life. not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything paid woman eleven silver sickles seven bronze knuts. ron stared as brought it all back in to compartment tipped it onto an empty seat. are you?” said harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. ron had taken out a lumpy package unwrapped it. there were four sandwiches inside. he pulled one of them apart said, always forgets i don’t like corned beef.” you for one of these,” said harry, holding up a pasty. on don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said ron. hasn’t got much time,” he added quickly, know, with five of us.” on, have a pasty,” said harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. it was a nice feeling, sitting there with ron, eating their way through all harry’s pasties, cakes, candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). are these?” asked ron, holding up a pack of chocolate frogs. not really frogs, are they?” he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. said ron. see what card is. i’m missing agrippa.” of course, you wouldn’t know chocolate frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect famous witches wizards. i’ve got about five hundred, but i haven’t got agrippa or ptolemy.” unwrapped his chocolate frog picked up card. it showed a man’s face. he wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, flowing silver hair, beard, mustache. underneath picture was name albus dumbledore. this is dumbledore!” said harry. tell me you’d never heard of dumbledore!” said ron. i have a frog? i might get agrippa thanks turned over his card read: albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many greatest wizard of modern times, dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of dark wizard grindelwald in for discovery of twelve uses of dragon’s blood, his work on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel. professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music ten pin bowling. turned card back over saw, to his astonishment, that dumbledore face had disappeared. gone!” you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said ron. be back. no, i’ve got morgana again i’ve got about six of her ... do you want it? you can start collecting.” ron’s eyes strayed to pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped. yourself,” said harry. in, you know, muggle world, people just stay put in photos.” they? what, they don’t move at all?” ron sounded amazed. stared as dumbledore sidled back into picture on his card gave him a small smile. ron was more interested in eating frogs than looking at famous witches wizards cards, but couldn’t keep his eyes off them. soon he had not only dumbledore morgana, but hengist of woodcraft, alberic grunnion, circe, paracelsus, merlin. he finally tore his eyes away from druidess cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of bertie bott’s every flavor beans. want to be careful with those,” ron warned harry. they say every flavor, they mean every flavor you know, you get all ordinary ones like chocolate peppermint marmalade, but then you can get spinach liver tripe. george reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, bit into a corner. see? sprouts.” they had a good time eating every flavor beans. got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, was even brave enough to nibble end off a funny gray one ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. countryside now flying past window was becoming wilder. neat fields had gone. now there were woods, twisting rivers, dark green hills. there was a knock on door of their compartment round-faced boy had passed on platform nine three-quarters came in. he looked tearful. he said, have you seen a toad at all?” when they shook their heads, he wailed, lost him! he keeps getting away from me!” turn up,” said harry. said boy miserably. if you see him ...” he left. know why he’s so bothered,” said ron. i’d brought a toad i’d lose it as quick as i could. mind you, i brought scabbers, so i can’t talk.” rat was still snoozing on ron’s lap. might have died you wouldn’t know difference,” said ron in disgust. tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but spell didn’t work. i’ll show you, look ...” he rummaged around in his trunk pulled out a very battered-looking wand. it was chipped in places something white was glinting at end. hair’s nearly poking out. anyway he had just raised his wand when compartment door slid open again. toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes. anyone seen a toad? neville’s lost one,” she said. she had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, rather large front teeth. already told him we haven’t seen it,” said ron, but girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at wand in his hand. are you doing magic? let’s see it, then.” she sat down. ron looked taken aback. all right.” he cleared his throat. sunshine , daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” he waved his wand, but nothing happened. scabbers stayed gray fast asleep. you sure that’s a real spell?” said girl. it’s not very good, is it? i’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice it’s all worked for me. nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter, but i was ever so pleased, of course, i mean, it’s very best school of witchcraft there is, i’ve heard i’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, i just hope it will be enough i’m hermione granger, by way, who are you?” she said all this very fast. looked at ron, was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all course books by heart either. ron weasley,” ron muttered. potter,” said harry. you really?” said hermione. know all about you, of course i got a few extra books for background reading, you’re in modern magical history rise fall of dark arts great wizarding events of twentieth century.” i?” said harry, feeling dazed. didn’t you know, i’d have found out everything i could if it was me,” said hermione. either of you know what house you’ll be in? i’ve been asking around, i hope i’m in gryffindor, it sounds by far best; i hear dumbledore himself was in it, but i suppose ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. ... anyway, we’d better go look for neville’s toad. you two had better change, you know, i expect we’ll be there soon.” she left, taking toadless boy with her. house i’m in, i hope she’s not in it,” said ron. he threw his wand back into his trunk. spell george gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.” house are your brothers in?” asked harry. said ron. gloom seemed to be settling on him again. dad were in it, too. i don’t know what they’ll say if i’m not. i don’t suppose ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in slytherin.” house vol-, i mean, you-know-who was in?” said ron. he flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. know, i think ends of scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter,” said harry, trying to take ron’s mind off houses. what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?” was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school. in romania studying dragons, bill’s in africa doing something for gringotts,” said ron. you hear about gringotts? it’s been all over daily prophet, but i don’t suppose you get that with muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault.” stared. what happened to them?” that’s why it’s such big news. they haven’t been caught. my dad says it must’ve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s what’s odd. everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case you-know-who’s behind it.” turned this news over in his mind. he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you-know- who was mentioned. he supposed this was all part of entering magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying without worrying. your quidditch team?” ron asked. i don’t know any,” confessed. ron looked dumbfounded. you wait, it’s best game in world he was off, explaining all about four balls positions of seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers broomstick he’d like to get if he had money. he was just taking through finer points of game when compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn’t neville toadless boy, or hermione granger this time. three boys entered, recognized middle one at once: it was pale boy from madam malkin’s robe shop. he was looking at with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in diagon alley. it true?” he said. saying all down train that potter’s in this compartment. so it’s you, is it?” said harry. he was looking at other boys. both of them were thickset looked extremely mean. standing on either side of pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. this is crabbe this is goyle,” said pale boy carelessly, noticing where was looking. my names malfoy, draco malfoy.” ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. draco malfoy looked at him. my name’s funny, do you? no need to ask who you are. my father told me all weasleys have red hair, freckles, more children than they can afford.” he turned back to harry. soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, potter. you don’t want to go making friends with wrong sort. i can help you there.” he held out his hand to shake harry’s, but didn’t take it. think i can tell who wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly. draco malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. be careful if i were you, potter,” he said slowly. you’re a bit politer you’ll go same way as your parents. they didn’t know what was good for them, either. you hang around with riffraff like weasleys that hagrid, it’ll rub off on you.” both ron stood up. that again,” ron said, his face as red as his hair. you’re going to fight us, are you?” malfoy sneered. you get out now,” said harry, more bravely than he felt, because crabbe goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron. we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? we’ve eaten all our food you still seem to have some.” goyle reached toward chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched goyle, goyle let out a horrible yell. scabbers rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle knuckle crabbe malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round round, howling, when scabbers finally flew off hit window, all three of them disappeared at once. perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, hermione granger had come in. has been going on?” she said, looking at sweets all over floor ron picking up scabbers by his tail. think he’s been knocked out,” ron said to harry. he looked closer at scabbers. i don’t believe it he’s gone back to sleep.” so he had. met malfoy before?” explained about their meeting in diagon alley. heard of his family,” said ron darkly. were some of first to come back to our side after you- know-who disappeared. said they’d been bewitched. my dad doesn’t believe it. he says malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to dark side.” he turned to hermione. we help you with something?” better hurry up put your robes on, i’ve just been up to front to ask conductor, he says we’re nearly there. you haven’t been fighting, have you? you’ll be in trouble before we even get there!” has been fighting, not us,” said ron, scowling at her. you mind leaving while we change?” right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up down corridors,” said hermione in a sniffy voice. you’ve got dirt on your nose, by way, did you know?” ron glared at her as she left. peered out of window. it was getting dark. he could see mountains forests under a deep purple sky. train did seem to be slowing down. he ron took off their jackets pulled on their long black robes. ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. a voice echoed through train: will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes’ time. please leave your luggage on train, it will be taken to school separately.” harry’s stomach lurched with nerves ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. they crammed their pockets with last of sweets joined crowd thronging corridor. train slowed right down finally stopped. people pushed their way toward door out on to a tiny, dark platform. shivered in cold night air. then a lamp came bobbing over heads of students, heard a familiar voice: years! firs’ years over here! all right there, harry?” hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over sea of heads. follow me any more firs’ years? mind yer step, now! firs’ years follow me!” slipping stumbling, they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. it was so dark on either side of them that thought there must be thick trees there. nobody spoke much. neville, boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. get yer firs’ sight o’ hogwarts in a sec,” hagrid called over his shoulder, round this bend here.” there was a loud narrow path had opened suddenly onto edge of a great black lake. perched atop a high mountain on other side, its windows sparkling in starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets towers. more’n four to a boat!” hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in water by shore. ron were followed into their boat by neville hermione. in?” shouted hagrid, who had a boat to himself. then forward!” fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across lake, which was as smooth as glass. everyone was silent, staring up at great castle overhead. it towered over them as they sailed nearer nearer to cliff on which it stood. down!” yelled hagrid as first boats reached cliff; they all bent their heads little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in cliff face. they were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks pebbles. you there! is this your toad?” said hagrid, who was checking boats as people climbed out of them. cried neville blissfully, holding out his hands. then they clambered up a passageway in rock after hagrid’s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in shadow of castle. they walked up a flight of steps crowded around huge, oak front door. here? you there, still got yer toad?” hagrid raised a gigantic fist knocked three times on castle door. sorting hat door swung open at once. a tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. she had a very stern face harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. firs’ years, professor mcgonagall,” said hagrid. you, hagrid. i will take them from here.” she pulled door wide. entrance hall was so big you could have fit whole of dursleys’ house in it. walls were lit with flaming torches like ones at gringotts, ceiling was too high to make out, a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to upper floors. they followed professor mcgonagall across flagged floor. could hear drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to right rest of school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed first years into a small, empty chamber off hall. they crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. to hogwarts,” said professor mcgonagall. start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in great hall, you will be sorted into your houses. sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within hogwarts. you will have classes with rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, spend free time in your house common room. four houses are called gryffindor, hufflepuff, ravenclaw, slytherin. each house has its own noble history each has produced outstanding witches wizards. while you are at hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule- breaking will lose house points. at end of year, house with most points is awarded house cup, a great honor. i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of rest of school. i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.” her eyes lingered for a moment on neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, on ron’s smudged nose. nervously tried to flatten his hair. shall return when we are ready for you,” said professor mcgonagall. wait quietly.” she left chamber. swallowed. exactly do they sort us into houses?” he asked ron. sort of test, i think. fred said it hurts a lot, but i think he was joking.” harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. a test? in front of whole school? but he didn’t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do? he hadn’t expected something like this moment they arrived. he looked around anxiously saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. no one was talking much except hermione granger, who was whispering very fast about all spells she’d learned wondering which one she’d need. tried hard not to listen to her. he’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue. he kept his eyes fixed on door. any second now, professor mcgonagall would come back lead him to his doom. then something happened that made him jump about a foot in air several people behind him screamed. ?” he gasped. so did people around him. about twenty ghosts had just streamed through back wall. pearly-white slightly transparent, they glided across room talking to one another hardly glancing at first years. they seemed to be arguing. what looked like a fat little monk was saying: forget, i say, we ought to give him a second chance dear friar, haven’t we given peeves all chances he deserves? he gives us all a bad name you know, he’s not really even a ghost i say, what are you all doing here?” a ghost wearing a ruff tights had suddenly noticed first years. nobody answered. students!” said fat friar, smiling around at them. to be sorted, i suppose?” a few people nodded mutely. to see you in hufflepuff!” said friar. old house, you know.” along now,” said a sharp voice. sorting ceremony’s about to start.” professor mcgonagall had returned. one by one, ghosts floated away through opposite wall. form a line,” professor mcgonagall told first years, follow me.” feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with ron behind him, they walked out of chamber, back across hall, through a pair of double doors into great hall. had never even imagined such a strange splendid place. it was lit by thousands thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where rest of students were sitting. these tables were laid with glittering golden plates goblets. at top of hall was another long table where teachers were sitting. professor mcgonagall led first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing other students, with teachers behind them. hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in flickering candlelight. dotted here there among students, ghosts shone misty silver. mainly to avoid all staring eyes, looked upward saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. he heard hermione whisper, bewitched to look like sky outside. i read about it in hogwarts, a history.” it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, that great hall didn’t simply open on to heavens. quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of first years. on top of stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. this hat was patched frayed extremely dirty. aunt petunia wouldn’t have let it in house. maybe they had to try get a rabbit out of it, thought wildly, that seemed sort of thing noticing that everyone in hall was now staring at hat, he stared at it, too. for a few seconds, there was complete silence. then hat twitched. a rip near brim opened wide like a mouth hat began to sing: you may not think i’m pretty, but don’t judge on what you see, i’ll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me. you can keep your bowlers black, your top hats sleek tall, for i’m hogwarts sorting hat i can cap them all. there’s nothing hidden in your head sorting hat can’t see, so try me on i will tell you where you ought to be. you might belong in gryffindor, where dwell brave at heart, their daring, nerve, chivalry set gryffindors apart; you might belong in hufflepuff, where they are just loyal, those patient hufflepuffs are true unafraid of toil; or yet in wise old ravenclaw, if you’ve a ready mind, where those of wit learning, will always find their kind; or perhaps in slytherin you’ll make your real friends, those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends. so put me on! don’t be afraid l\\ don’t get in a flap\\ you’re in safe hands (though i have none) for i’m a thinking cap\\” whole hall burst into applause as hat finished its song. it bowed to each of four tables then became quite still again. we’ve just got to try on hat!” ron whispered to harry. kill fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.” smiled weakly. yes, trying on hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at moment. if only hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been one for him. professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. i call your name, you will put on hat sit on stool to be sorted,” she said. hannah!” a pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on hat, which fell right down over her eyes, sat down. a moment’s pause shouted hat. table on right cheered clapped as hannah went to sit down at hufflepuff table. saw ghost of fat friar waving merrily at her. susan!” shouted hat again, susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah. terry!” table second from left clapped this time; several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them. mandy” went to ravenclaw too, but lavender” became first new gryffindor, table on far left exploded with cheers; could see ron’s twin brothers catcalling. millicent” then became a slytherin. perhaps it was harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. he was starting to feel definitely sick now. he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. he had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him. justin!” sometimes, noticed, hat shouted out house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. seamus,” sandy-haired boy next to in line, sat on stool for almost a whole minute before hat declared him a gryffindor. hermione!” hermione almost ran to stool jammed hat eagerly on her head. shouted hat. ron groaned. a horrible thought struck harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. what if he wasn’t chosen at all? what if he just sat there with hat over his eyes for ages, until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head said there had obviously been a mistake he’d better get back on train? when neville longbottom, boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to stool. hat took a long time to decide with neville. when it finally shouted, neville ran off still wearing it, had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to morag.” malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called got his wish at once: hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, malfoy went to join his friends crabbe goyle, looking pleased with himself. there weren’t many people left now. , ... , ... , then a pair of twin girls, ... , then sally- anne” . . . , then, at last harry!” as stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over hall. , did she say?” potter?” last thing saw before hat dropped over his eyes was hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. next second he was looking at black inside of hat. he waited. said a small voice in his ear. very difficult. plenty of courage, i see. not a bad mind either. there’s talent, oh my goodness, yes a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. ... so where shall i put you?” gripped edges of stool thought, not slytherin, not slytherin. slytherin, eh?” said small voice. you sure? you could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, slytherin will help you on way to greatness, no doubt about that no? well, if you’re sure better be gryffindor!” heard hat shout last word to whole hall. he took off hat walked shakily toward gryffindor table. he was so relieved to have been chosen not put in slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting loudest cheer yet. percy prefect got up shook his hand vigorously, while weasley twins yelled, got potter! we got potter!” sat down opposite ghost in ruff he’d seen earlier. ghost patted his arm, giving sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. he could see high table properly now. at end nearest him sat hagrid, who caught his eye gave him thumbs up. grinned back. there, in center of high table, in a large gold chair, sat albus dumbledore. recognized him at once from card he’d gotten out of chocolate frog on train. dumbledore’s silver hair was only thing in whole hall that shone as brightly as ghosts. spotted professor quirrell, too, nervous young man from leaky cauldron. he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. now there were only four people left to be sorted. dean,” a black boy even taller than ron, joined at gryffindor table. lisa,” became a ravenclaw then it was ron’s turn. he was pale green by now. crossed his fingers under table a second later hat had shouted, clapped loudly with rest as ron collapsed into chair next to him. done, ron, excellent,” said percy weasley pompously across as blaise,” was made a slytherin. professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll took sorting hat away. looked down at his empty gold plate. he had only just realized how hungry he was. pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet. he was beaming at students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. he said. to a new year at hogwarts! before we begin our banquet, i would like to say a few words. here they are: nitwit! blubber! oddment! tweak! you!” he sat back down. everybody clapped cheered. didn’t know whether to laugh or not. he a bit mad?” he asked percy uncertainly. said percy airily. a genius! best wizard in world! but he is a bit mad, yes. potatoes, harry?” harry’s mouth fell open. dishes in front of him were now piled with food. he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops lamb chops, sausages, bacon steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. dursleys had never exactly starved harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. dudley had always taken anything that really wanted, even if it made him sick. piled his plate with a bit of everything except peppermints began to eat. it was all delicious. does look good,” said ghost in ruff sadly, watching cut up his steak. you ?” haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said ghost. don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. i don’t think i’ve introduced myself? sir nicholas de mimsy-porpington at your service. resident ghost of gryffindor tower.” know who you are!” said ron suddenly. brothers told me about you you’re nearly headless nick!” would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired seamus finnigan interrupted. headless? how can you be nearly headless?” sir nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all way he wanted. this,” he said irritably. he seized his left ear pulled. his whole head swung off his neck fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. looking pleased at stunned looks on their faces, nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, said, new gryffindors! i hope you’re going to help us win house championship this year? gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. slytherins have got cup six years in a row! bloody baron’s becoming almost unbearable he’s slytherin ghost.” looked over at slytherin table saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, robes stained with silver blood. he was right next to malfoy who, was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with seating arrangements. did he get covered in blood?” asked seamus with great interest. never asked,” said nearly headless nick delicately. when everyone had eaten as much as they could, remains of food faded from plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. a moment later desserts appeared. blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jell- 0, rice pudding ... as helped himself to a treacle tart, talk turned to their families. half-and-half,” said seamus. dad’s a muggle. mom didn’t tell him she was a witch after they were married. bit of a nasty shock for him.” others laughed. about you, neville?” said ron. my gran brought me up she’s a witch,” said neville, family thought i was all- muggle for ages. my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard force some magic out of me he pushed me off end of blackpool pier once, i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight. great uncle algie came round for dinner, he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue he accidentally let go. but i bounced all way down garden into road. they were all really pleased, gran was crying, she was so happy. you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come, you see. great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.” on harry’s other side, percy weasley hermione were talking about lessons (“i do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, i’m particularly interested in transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult be starting small, just matches into needles that sort of thing harry, who was starting to feel warm sleepy, looked up at high table again. hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore. professor quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, sallow skin. it happened very suddenly. hook-nosed teacher looked past quirrell’s turban straight into harry’s eyes a sharp, hot pain shot across scar on harry’s forehead. clapped a hand to his head. is it?” asked percy. pain had gone as quickly as it had come. harder to shake off was feeling had gotten from teacher’s look a feeling that he didn’t like at all. that teacher talking to professor quirrell?” he asked percy. you know quirrell already, do you? no wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s professor snape. he teaches potions, but he doesn’t want to everyone knows he’s after quirrell’s job. knows an awful lot about dark arts, snape.” watched snape for a while, but snape didn’t look at him again. at last, desserts too disappeared, professor dumbledore got to his feet again. hall fell silent. just a few more words now that we are all fed watered. i have a few start-of-term notices to give you. years should note that forest on grounds is forbidden to all pupils. a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.” dumbledore twinkling eyes flashed in direction of weasley twins. have also been asked by mr. filch, caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in corridors. trials will be held in second week of term. anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch. finally, i must tell you that this year, third- floor corridor on right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.” laughed, but he was one of few who did. not serious?” he muttered to percy. be,” said percy, frowning at dumbledore. odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. i do think he might have told us prefects, at least.” now, before we go to bed, let us sing school song!” cried dumbledore. noticed that other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed. dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off end, a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above tables twisted itself, snakelike, into words. pick their favorite tune,” said dumbledore, off we go!” school bellowed: hogwarts, hoggy warty hogwarts, teach us something please, whether we be old bald or young with scabby knees, our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff, for now they’re bare full of air, dead flies bits of fluff, so teach us things worth knowing, bring back what we’ve forgot, just do your best, we’ll do rest, learn until our brains all rot.” everybody finished song at different times. at last, only weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. music,” he said, wiping his eyes. magic beyond all we do here! now, bedtime. off you trot!” gryffindor first years followed percy through chattering crowds, out of great hall, up marble staircase. harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired full of food. he was too sleepy even to be surprised that people in portraits along corridors whispered pointed as they passed, or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels hanging tapestries. they climbed more staircases, yawning dragging their feet, was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. percy whispered to first years. poltergeist.” he raised his voice, show yourself.” a loud, rude sound, like air being let out of a balloon, answered. you want me to go to bloody baron?” there was a pop, a little man with wicked, dark eyes a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in air, clutching walking sticks. he said, with an evil cackle. firsties! what fun!” he swooped suddenly at them. they all ducked. away, peeves, or baron’ll hear about this, i mean it!” barked percy. peeves stuck out his tongue vanished, dropping walking sticks on neville’s head. they heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. want to watch out for peeves,” said percy, as they set off again. bloody baron’s only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. here we are.” at very end of corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. she said. draconis,” said percy, portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in wall. they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up found themselves in gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. percy directed girls through one door to their dormitory boys through another. at top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of towers they found their beds at last: five four- posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. their trunks had already been brought up. too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas fell into bed. food, isn’t it?” ron muttered to through hangings. off scabbers! he’s chewing my sheets.” was going to ask ron if he’d had any of treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. perhaps had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. he was wearing professor quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. told turban he didn’t want to be in slytherin; it got heavier heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully there was malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into hook-nosed teacher, snape, whose laugh became high cold there was a burst of green light woke, sweating shaking. he rolled over fell asleep again, when he woke next day, he didn’t remember dream at all. potions master look.” to tall kid with red hair.” glasses?” you see his face?” you see his scar?” whispers followed from moment he left his dormitory next day. people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in corridors again, staring. wished they wouldn’t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. there were a hundred forty-two staircases at hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly right place, doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. it was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. people in portraits kept going to visit each other, was sure coats of armor could walk. ghosts didn’t help, either. it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in right direction, but peeves poltergeist was worth two locked doors a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, screech, your conk!” even worse than peeves, if that was possible, was caretaker, argus filch. ron managed to get on wrong side of him on their very first morning. filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be entrance to out-of-bounds corridor on third floor. he wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, was threatening to lock them in dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell, who was passing. filch owned a cat called mrs. norris, a scrawny, dust- colored creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like filch’s. she patrolled corridors alone. break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, she’d whisk off for filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. filch knew secret passageways of school better than anyone (except perhaps weasley twins) could pop up as suddenly as any of ghosts. students all hated him, it was dearest ambition of many to give mrs. norris a good kick. then, once you had managed to find them, there were classes themselves. there was a lot more to magic, as quickly found out, than waving your wand saying a few funny words. they had to study night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight learn names of different stars movements of planets. three times a week they went out to greenhouses behind castle to study herbology, with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout, where they learned how to take care of all strange plants fungi, found out what they were used for. easily most boring class was history of magic, which was only one taught by a ghost. professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of staff room fire got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. binns droned on on while they scribbled down names dates, got emeric evil uric oddball mixed up. professor flitwick, charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. at start of their first class he took roll call, when he reached harry’s name he gave an excited squeak toppled out of sight. professor mcgonagall was again different. had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. strict clever, she gave them a talking- to moment they sat down in her first class. is some of most complex dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts,” she said. messing around in my class will leave not come back. you have been warned.” then she changed her desk into a pig back again. they were all very impressed couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing furniture into animals for a long time. after taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match started trying to turn it into a needle. by end of lesson, only hermione granger had made any difference to her match; professor mcgonagall showed class how it had gone all silver pointy gave hermione a rare smile. class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against dark arts, but quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. his classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in romania was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. his turban, he told them, had been given to him by an african prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren’t sure they believed this story. for one thing, when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off zombie, quirrell went pink started talking about weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around turban, weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that quirrell was protected wherever he went. was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else. lots of people had come from muggle families and, like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches wizards. there was so much to learn that even people like ron didn’t have much of a head start. friday was an important day for ron. they finally managed to find their way down to great hall for breakfast without getting lost once. have we got today?” asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. potions with slytherins,” said ron. head of slytherin house. they say he always favors them we’ll be able to see if it’s true.” mcgonagall favored us,” said harry. professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house, but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework day before. just then, mail arrived. had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into great hall during breakfast, circling tables until they saw their owners, dropping letters packages onto their laps. hedwig hadn’t brought anything so far. she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in owlery with other school owls. this morning, however, she fluttered down between marmalade sugar bowl dropped a note onto harry’s plate. tore it open at once. it said, in a very untidy scrawl: dear harry, i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come have a cup of tea with me around three? i want to hear all about your first week. send us an answer back with hedwig. hagrid borrowed ron’s quill, scribbled yes, please, see you later on back of note, sent hedwig off again. it was lucky that had tea with hagrid to look forward to, because potions lesson turned out to be worst thing that had happened to him so far. at start-of-term banquet, had gotten idea that professor snape disliked him. by end of first potions lesson, he knew he’d been wrong. snape didn’t dislike he hated him. potions lessons took place down in one of dungeons. it was colder here than up in main castle, would have been quite creepy enough without pickled animals floating in glass jars all around walls. snape, like flitwick, started class by taking roll call, like flitwick, he paused at harry’s name. yes,” he said softly, potter. our new celebrity.” draco malfoy his friends crabbe goyle sniggered behind their hands. snape finished calling names looked up at class. his eyes were black like hagrid but they had none of hagrid warmth. they were cold empty made you think of dark tunnels. are here to learn subtle science exact art of potion-making,” he began. he spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall, snape had gift of keeping a class silent without effort. there is little foolish wand- waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. i don’t expect you will really understand beauty of softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching mind, ensnaring senses. ... i can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach.” more silence followed this little speech. ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. hermione granger was on edge of her seat looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead. said snape suddenly. would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” powdered root of what to an infusion of what? glanced at ron, who looked as stumped as he was; hermione hand had shot into air. don’t know, sir,” said harry. snape lips curled into a sneer. tut fame clearly isn’t everything.” he ignored hermione hand. try again. potter, where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar?” hermione stretched her hand as high into air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but didn’t have faintest idea what a bezoar was. he tried not to look at malfoy, crabbe, goyle, who were shaking with laughter. don’t know, sir.” you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, potter?” forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. he had looked through his books at dursleys’, but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs fungi ? snape was still ignoring hermione’s quivering hand. is difference, potter, between monkshood wolfsbane?” at this, hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward dungeon ceiling. don’t know,” said quietly. think hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?” a few people laughed; caught seamus’s eye, seamus winked. snape, however, was not pleased. down,” he snapped at hermione. your information, potter, asphodel wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as draught of living death. a bezoar is a taken from stomach of a goat it will save you from most poisons. as for monkshood wolfsbane, they are same plant, which also goes by name of aconite. well? why aren’t you all copying that down?” there was a sudden rummaging for quills parchment. over noise, snape said, a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek, potter.” things didn’t improve for gryffindors as potions lesson continued. snape put them all into pairs set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. he swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except malfoy, whom he seemed to like. he was just telling everyone to look at perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke a loud hissing filled dungeon. neville had somehow managed to melt seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, their potion was seeping across floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. within seconds, whole class was standing on their stools while neville, who had been drenched in potion when cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms legs. boy!” snarled snape, clearing spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. suppose you added porcupine quills before taking cauldron off fire?” neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. him up to hospital wing,” snape spat at seamus. then he rounded on ron, who had been working next to neville. why didn’t you tell him not to add quills? thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? that’s another point you’ve lost for gryffindor.” this was so unfair that opened his mouth to argue, but ron kicked him behind their cauldron. push it,” he muttered, heard snape can turn very nasty.” as they climbed steps out of dungeon an hour later, harry’s mind was racing his spirits were low. he’d lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much? up,” said ron, always taking points off fred george. can i come meet hagrid with you?” at five to three they left castle made their way across grounds. hagrid lived in a small wooden house on edge of forbidden forest. a crossbow a pair of galoshes were outside front door. when knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside several booming barks. then hagrid voice rang out, saying, fang back.” hagrid big, hairy face appeared in crack as he pulled door open. on,” he said. fang.” he let them in, struggling to keep a hold on collar of an enormous black boarhound. there was only one room inside. hams pheasants were hanging from ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on open fire, in corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. yerselves at home,” said hagrid, letting go of fang, who bounded straight at ron started licking his ears. like hagrid, fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. is ron,” told hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot putting rock cakes onto a plate. weasley, eh?” said hagrid, glancing at ron’s freckles. spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from forest.” rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons. fang rested his head on harry’s knee drooled all over his robes. ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch old git.” as fer that cat, mrs. norris, i’d like ter introduce her to fang sometime. d’yeh know, every time i go up ter school, she follows me everywhere? can’t get rid of her filch puts her up to it.” told hagrid about snape’s lesson. hagrid, like ron, told not to worry about it, that snape liked hardly any of students. he seemed to really hate me.” said hagrid. should he?” yet couldn’t help thinking that hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that. yer brother charlie?” hagrid asked ron. liked him a lot great with animals.” wondered if hagrid had changed subject on purpose. while ron told hagrid all about charlie’s work with dragons, picked up a piece of paper that was lying on table under tea cozy. it was a cutting from daily prophet : gringotts break-in latest investigations continue into break-in at gringotts on july, widely believed to be work of dark wizards or witches unknown. gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. vault that was searched had in fact been emptied same day. we’re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you,” said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. remembered ron telling him on train that someone had tried to rob gringotts, but ron hadn’t mentioned date. said harry, gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! it might’ve been happening while we were there!” there was no doubt about it, hagrid definitely didn’t meet harry’s eyes this time. he grunted offered him another rock cake. read story again. vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. had that been what thieves were looking for? as ron walked back to castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse, thought that none of lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid. had hagrid collected that package just in time? where was it now? did hagrid know something about snape that he didn’t want to tell harry? midnight duel had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley, but that was before he met draco malfoy. still, first-year gryffindors only had potions with slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with malfoy much. or at least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in gryffindor common room that made them all groan. flying lessons would be starting on thursday gryffindor slytherin would be learning together. said darkly. what i always wanted. to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy.” he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said ron reasonably. i know malfoy’s always going on about how good he is at quidditch, but i bet that’s all talk.” malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. he complained loudly about first years never getting on house quidditch teams told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters. he wasn’t only one, though: way seamus finnigan told it, he’d spent most of his childhood zooming around countryside on his broomstick. even ron would tell anyone who’d listen about time he’d almost hit a hang glider on charlie’s old broom. everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly. ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. ron couldn’t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. had caught ron prodding dean’s poster of west ham soccer team, trying to make players move. neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. privately, felt she’d had good reason, because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on ground. hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was. this was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn’t tried. at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library book called quidditch through ages. neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when hermione lecture was interrupted by arrival of mail. hadn’t had a single letter since hagrid’s note, something that malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. malfoy eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at slytherin table. a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother. he opened it excitedly showed them a glass ball size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. a remembrall!” he explained. knows i forget things this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. look, you hold it tight like this if it turns red oh ...” his face fell, because remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, you’ve forgotten something ...” neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when draco malfoy, who was passing gryffindor table, snatched remembrall out of his hand. ron jumped to their feet. they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy, but professor mcgonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in school, was there in a flash. going on?” got my remembrall, professor.” scowling, malfoy quickly dropped remembrall back on table. looking,” he said, he sloped away with crabbe goyle behind him. at three-thirty that afternoon, harry, ron, other gryffindors hurried down front steps onto grounds for their first flying lesson. it was a clear, breezy day, grass rippled under their feet as they marched down sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on opposite side of grounds to forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in distance. slytherins were already there, so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on ground. had heard fred george weasley complain about school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to left. their teacher, madam hooch, arrived. she had short, gray hair, yellow eyes like a hawk. what are you all waiting for?” she barked. stand by a broomstick. come on, hurry up.” \" glanced down at his broom. it was old some of twigs stuck out at odd angles. out your right hand over your broom,” called madam hooch at front, say everyone shouted. harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of few that did. hermione granger’s had simply rolled over on ground, neville’s hadn’t moved at all. perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought harry; there was a quaver in neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on ground. madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off end, walked up down rows correcting their grips. ron were delighted when she told malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years. when i blow my whistle, you kick off from ground, hard,” said madam hooch. your brooms steady, rise a few feet, then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. on my whistle three two but neville, nervous jumpy frightened of being left on ground, pushed off hard before whistle had touched madam hooch’s lips. back, boy!” she shouted, but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet. saw his scared white face look down at ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off broom wham a thud a nasty crack neville lay facedown on grass in a heap. his broomstick was still rising higher higher, started to drift lazily toward forbidden forest out of sight. madam hooch was bending over neville, her face as white as his. wrist,” heard her mutter. on, boy it’s all right, up you get.” she turned to rest of class. of you is to move while i take this boy to hospital wing! you leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of hogwarts before you can say come on, dear.” neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with madam hooch, who had her arm around him. no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter. you see his face, great lump?” other slytherins joined in. up, malfoy,” snapped parvati patil. sticking up for longbottom?” said pansy parkinson, a hard-faced slytherin girl. thought you’d like fat little crybabies, parvati.” said malfoy, darting forward snatching something out of grass. that stupid thing longbottom’s gran sent him.” remembrall glittered in sun as he held it up. that here, malfoy,” said quietly. everyone stopped talking to watch. malfoy smiled nastily. think i’ll leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree?” it here!” yelled, but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick taken off. he hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. hovering level with topmost branches of an oak he called, get it, potter!” grabbed his broom. shouted hermione granger. hooch told us not to move you’ll get us all into trouble.” ignored her. blood was pounding in his ears. he mounted broom kicked hard against ground up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, his robes whipped out behind him in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught this was easy, this was wonderful. he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, heard screams gasps of girls back on ground an admiring whoop from ron. he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair. malfoy looked stunned. it here,” called, i’ll knock you off that broom!” yeah?” said malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. knew, somehow, what to do. he leaned forward grasped broom tightly in both hands, it shot toward malfoy like a javelin. malfoy only just got out of way in time; made a sharp about- face held broom steady. a few people below were clapping. crabbe goyle up here to save your neck, malfoy,” called. same thought seemed to have struck malfoy. it if you can, then!” he shouted, he threw glass ball high into air streaked back toward ground. saw, as though in slow motion, ball rise up in air then start to fall. he leaned forward pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing ball wind whistled in his ears, mingled with screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, he toppled gently onto grass with remembrall clutched safely in his fist. potter!” his heart sank faster than he’d just dived. professor mcgonagall was running toward them. he got to his feet, trembling. in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock, her glasses flashed furiously, how dare you might have broken your neck wasn’t his fault, professor quiet, miss patil malfoy enough, mr. weasley. potter, follow me, now.” caught sight of malfoy, crabbe, goyle’s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in professor mcgonagall’s wake as she strode toward castle. he was going to be expelled, he just knew it. he wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. now he’d done it. he hadn’t even lasted two weeks. he’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. what would dursleys say when he turned up on doorstep? up front steps, up marble staircase inside, still professor mcgonagall didn’t say a word to him. she wrenched open doors marched along corridors with trotting miserably behind her. maybe she was taking him to dumbledore. he thought of hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. perhaps he could be hagrid’s assistant. his stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching ron others becoming wizards while he stumped around grounds carrying hagrid’s bag. professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom. she opened door poked her head inside. me, professor flitwick, could i borrow wood for a moment?” wood? thought harry, bewildered; was wood a cane she was going to use on him? but wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of flitwick’s class looking confused. me, you two,” said professor mcgonagall, they marched on up corridor, wood looking curiously at harry. here.” professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves, who was busy writing rude words on blackboard. peeves!” she barked. peeves threw chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, he swooped out cursing. professor mcgonagall slammed door behind him turned to face two boys. this is oliver wood. wood i’ve found you a seeker.” wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. you serious, professor?” said professor mcgonagall crisply. boy’s a natural. i’ve never seen anything like it. was that your first time on a broomstick, potter?” nodded silently. he didn’t have a clue what was going on, but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, some of feeling started coming back to his legs. caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” professor mcgonagall told wood. even scratch himself. charlie weasley couldn’t have done it.” wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. seen a game of quidditch, potter?” he asked excitedly. captain of gryffindor team,” professor mcgonagall explained. just build for a seeker, too,” said wood, now walking around staring at him. speedy we’ll have to get him a decent broom, professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven, i’d say.” shall speak to professor dumbledore see if we can’t bend first-year rule. heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. flattened in that last match by slytherin, i couldn’t look severus snape in face for weeks. ...” professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry. want to hear you’re training hard, potter, or i may change my mind about punishing you.” then she suddenly smiled. father would have been proud,” she said. was an excellent quidditch player himself.” joking.” it was dinnertime. had just finished telling ron what had happened when he’d left grounds with professor mcgonagall. ron had a piece of steak kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he’d forgotten all about it. he said. first years never you must be youngest house player in about a century,” said harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. he felt particularly hungry after excitement of afternoon. told me.” ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat gaped at harry. start training next week,” said harry. don’t tell anyone, wood wants to keep it a secret.” fred george weasley now came into hall, spotted harry, hurried over. done,” said george in a low voice. told us. we’re on team too beaters.” tell you, we’re going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year,” said fred. haven’t won since charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. you must be good, harry, wood was almost skipping when he told us.” we’ve got to go, lee jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of school.” it’s that one behind statue of gregory smarmy that we found in our first week. see you.” fred george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: malfoy, flanked by crabbe goyle. a last meal, potter? when are you getting train back to muggles?” a lot braver now that you’re back on ground you’ve got your little friends with you,” said coolly. there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe goyle, but as high table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles scowl. take you on anytime on my own,” said malfoy. if you want. wizard’s duel. wands only no contact. what’s matter? never heard of a wizard’s duel before, i suppose?” course he has,” said ron, wheeling around. his second, who’s yours?” malfoy looked at crabbe goyle, sizing them up. he said. all right? well meet you in trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” when malfoy had gone, ron looked at each other. is a wizard’s duel?” said harry. what do you mean, you’re my second?” a second’s there to take over if you die,” said ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. catching look on harry’s face, he added quickly, people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. most you malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. i bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.” what if i wave my wand nothing happens?” it away punch him on nose,” ron suggested. me.” they both looked up. it was hermione granger. a person eat in peace in this place?” said ron. hermione ignored him spoke to harry. couldn’t help overhearing what you malfoy were saying you could,” ron muttered. you mustn’t go wandering around school at night, think of points you’ll lose gryffindor if you’re caught, you’re bound to be. it’s really very selfish of you.” it’s really none of your business,” said harry. said ron. all same, it wasn’t what you’d call perfect end to day, thought, as he lay awake much later listening to dean seamus falling asleep (neville wasn’t back from hospital wing). ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because i can’t remember how to block them.” there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs. norris, felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. on other hand, malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face-to-face. he couldn’t miss it. eleven,” ron muttered at last, better go.” they pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, crept across tower room, down spiral staircase, into gryffindor common room. a few embers were still glowing in fireplace, turning all armchairs into hunched black shadows. they had almost reached portrait hole when a voice spoke from chair nearest them, can’t believe you’re going to do this, harry.” a lamp flickered on. it was hermione granger, wearing a pink bathrobe a frown. said ron furiously. back to bed!” almost told your brother,” hermione snapped, he’s a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. on,” he said to ron. he pushed open portrait of fat lady climbed through hole. hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. she followed ron through portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. you care about gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, don’t want slytherin to win house cup, you’ll lose all points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells.” away.” right, but i warned you, you just remember what i said when you’re on train home tomorrow, you’re so but what they were, they didn’t find out. hermione had turned to portrait of fat lady to get back inside found herself facing an empty painting. fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower. what am i going to do?” she asked shrilly. your problem,” said ron. got to go, we’re going to be late.” they hadn’t even reached end of corridor when hermione caught up with them. coming with you,” she said. are not.” think i’m going to stand out here wait for filch to catch me? if he finds all three of us i’ll tell him truth, that i was trying to stop you, you can back me up.” got some nerve said ron loudly. up, both of you!” said sharply. heard something.” it was a sort of snuffling. norris?” breathed ron, squinting through dark. it wasn’t mrs. norris. it was neville. he was curled up on floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. goodness you found me! i’ve been out here for hours, i couldn’t remember new password to get in to bed.” your voice down, neville. password’s snout’ but it won’t help you now, fat lady’s gone off somewhere.” your arm?” said harry. said neville, showing them. pomfrey mended it in about a minute.” well, look, neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll see you later leave me!” said neville, scrambling to his feet, don’t want to stay here alone, bloody baron’s been past twice already.” ron looked at his watch then glared furiously at hermione neville. either of you get us caught, i’ll never rest until i’ve learned that curse of bogies quirrell told us about, used it on you.” hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use curse of bogies, but hissed at her to be quiet beckoned them all forward. they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from high windows. at every turn expected to run into filch or mrs. norris, but they were lucky. they sped up a staircase to third floor tiptoed toward trophy room. malfoy crabbe weren’t there yet. crystal trophy cases glimmered where moonlight caught them. cups, shields, plates, statues winked silver gold in darkness. they edged along walls, keeping their eyes on doors at either end of room. took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in started at once. minutes crept by. late, maybe he’s chickened out,” ron whispered. then a noise in next room made them jump. had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak it wasn’t malfoy. around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.” it was filch speaking to mrs. norris. horror-struck, waved madly at other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward door, away from filch’s voice. neville’s robes had barely whipped round corner when they heard filch enter trophy room. in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, hiding.” way!” mouthed to others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. they could hear filch getting nearer. neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak broke into a run he tripped, grabbed ron around waist, pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. clanging crashing were enough to wake whole castle. yelled, four of them sprinted down gallery, not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around doorpost galloped down one corridor then another, in lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it came out near their charms classroom, which they knew was miles from trophy room. think we’ve lost him,” panted, leaning against cold wall wiping his forehead. neville was bent double, wheezing spluttering. told you,” hermione gasped, clutching at stitch in her chest, told you.” got to get back to gryffindor tower,” said ron, as possible.” tricked you,” hermione said to harry. realize that, don’t you? he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in trophy room, malfoy must have tipped him off.” thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell her that. go.” it wasn’t going to be that simple. they hadn’t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. it was peeves. he caught sight of them gave a squeal of delight. up, peeves please you’ll get us thrown out.” peeves cackled. around at midnight, ickle firsties? tut, tut, tut. naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” if you don’t give us away, peeves, please.” tell filch, i should,” said peeves in a sanity voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. for your own good, you know.” out of way,” snapped ron, taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake. out of bed!” peeves bellowed, out of bed down charms corridor!” ducking under peeves, they ran for their lives, right to end of corridor where they slammed into a door it was locked. is it!” ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at door, done for! this is end!” they could hear footsteps, filch running as fast as he could toward peeves shouts. move over,” hermione snarled. she grabbed harry’s wand, tapped lock, whispered, lock clicked door swung open they piled through it, shut it quickly, pressed their ears against it, listening. way did they go, peeves?” filch was saying. tell me.” mess with me, peeves, now where did they go?” say nothing if you don’t say please,” said peeves in his annoying singsong voice. right please.” ha haaa! told you i wouldn’t say nothing if you didn’t say please! ha ha! haaaaaa!” they heard sound of peeves whooshing away filch cursing in rage. thinks this door is locked,” whispered. think well be okay get off neville!” for neville had been tugging on sleeve of harry’s bathrobe for last minute. turned around saw, quite clearly, what. for a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. they weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. they were in a corridor. forbidden corridor on third floor. now they knew why it was forbidden. they were looking straight into eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled whole space between ceiling floor. it had three heads. three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. it was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, knew that only reason they weren’t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. groped for doorknob between filch death, he’d take filch. they fell backward slammed door shut, they ran, they almost flew, back down corridor. filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them that monster. they didn’t stop running until they reached portrait of fat lady on seventh floor. on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders their flushed, sweaty faces. mind that pig snout, pig snout,” panted harry, portrait swung forward. they scrambled into common room collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. it was a while before any of them said anything. neville, indeed, looked as if he’d never speak again. do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?” said ron finally. any dog needs exercise, that one does.” hermione had got both her breath her bad temper back again. don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. you see what it was standing on?” floor?” suggested. wasn’t looking at its feet, i was too busy with its heads.” not floor. it was standing on a trapdoor. it’s obviously guarding something.” she stood up, glaring at them. hope you’re pleased with yourselves. we could all have been killed or worse, expelled. now, if you don’t mind, i’m going to bed.” ron stared after her, his mouth open. we don’t mind,” he said. think we dragged her along, wouldn’t you?” but hermione had given something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. dog was guarding something. . . . what had hagrid said? gringotts was safest place in world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts. it looked as though had found out where grubby little package from vault seven hundred thirteen was. halloween malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that ron were still at hogwarts next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. indeed, by next morning ron thought that meeting three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, they were quite keen to have another one. in meantime, filled ron in about package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts, they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. either really valuable or really dangerous,” said ron. both,” said harry. but as all they knew for sure about mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. neither neville nor hermione showed slightest interest in what lay underneath dog trapdoor. all neville cared about was never going near dog again. hermione was now refusing to speak to ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy, to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in mail about a week later. as owls flooded into great hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, was amazed when owls soared down dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to floor. they had hardly fluttered out of way when another owl dropped a letter on top of parcel. ripped open letter first, which was lucky, because it said: do not open parcel at table. it contains your new nimbus two thousand, but i don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. oliver wood will meet you tonight on quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session. professor m. mcgonagall had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed note to ron to read. nimbus two thousand!” ron moaned enviously. never even touched one.” they left hall quickly, wanting to unwrap broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across entrance hall they found way upstairs barred by crabbe goyle. malfoy seized package from felt it. a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to with a mixture of jealousy spite on his face. be in for it this time, potter, first years aren’t allowed them.” ron couldn’t resist it. not any old broomstick,” he said, a nimbus two thousand. what did you say you’ve got at home, malfoy, a comet two sixty?” ron grinned at harry. look flashy, but they’re not in same league as nimbus.” would you know about it, weasley, you couldn’t afford half handle,” malfoy snapped back. suppose you your brothers have to save up twig by twig.” before ron could answer, professor flitwick appeared at malfoy’s elbow. arguing, i hope, boys?” he squeaked. been sent a broomstick, professor,” said malfoy quickly. yes, that’s right,” said professor flitwick, beaming at harry. mcgonagall told me all about special circumstances, potter. what model is it?” nimbus two thousand, sir,” said harry, fighting not to laugh at look of horror on malfoy’s face. it’s really thanks to malfoy here that i’ve got it,” he added. ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at malfoy’s obvious rage confusion. it’s true,” chortled as they reached top of marble staircase, he hadn’t stolen neville’s remembrall i wouldn’t be on team. ...” i suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came an angry voice from just behind them. hermione was stomping up stairs, looking disapprovingly at package in harry’s hand. thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said harry. don’t stop now,” said ron, doing us so much good.” hermione marched away with her nose in air. had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. it kept wandering up to dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap nimbus two thousand at last. ron sighed, as broomstick rolled onto harry’s bedspread. even harry, who knew nothing about different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. sleek shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs nimbus two thousand written in gold near top. as seven o’clock drew nearer, left castle set off in dusk toward quidditch field. he’d never been inside stadium before. hundreds of seats were raised in stands around field so that spectators were high enough to see what was going on. at either end of field were three golden poles with hoops on end. they reminded of little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. too eager to fly again to wait for wood, mounted his broomstick kicked off from ground. what a feeling he swooped in out of goal posts then sped up down field. nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. potter, come down!” oliver wood had arrived. he was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. landed next to him. nice,” said wood, his eyes glinting. see what mcgonagall meant ... you really are a natural. i’m just going to teach you rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.” he opened crate. inside were four different-sized balls. said wood. quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. there are seven players on each side. three of them are called chasers.” chasers,” repeated, as wood took out a bright red ball about size of a soccer ball. ball’s called quaffle,” said wood. chasers throw quaffle to each other try get it through one of hoops to score a goal. ten points every time quaffle goes through one of hoops. follow me?” chasers throw quaffle put it through hoops to score,” recited. that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” basketball?” said wood curiously. mind,” said quickly. there’s another player on each side who’s called keeper i’m keeper for gryffindor. i have to fly around our hoops stop other team from scoring.” chasers, one keeper,” said harry, who was determined to remember it all. they play with quaffle. okay, got that. so what are they for?” he pointed at three balls left inside box. show you now,” said wood. this.” he handed a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. going to show you what bludgers do,” wood said. two are bludgers.” he showed two identical balls, jet black slightly smaller than red quaffle. noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape straps holding them inside box. back,” wood warned harry. he bent down freed one of bludgers. at once, black ball rose high in air then pelted straight at harry’s face. swung at it with bat to stop it from breaking his nose, sent it zigzagging away into air it zoomed around their heads then shot at wood, who dived on top of it managed to pin it to ground. wood panted, forcing struggling bludger back into crate strapping it down safely. bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. that’s why you have two beaters on each team weasley twins are ours it’s their job to protect their side from bludgers try knock them toward other team. so think you’ve got all that?” chasers try score with quaffle; keeper guards goal posts; beaters keep bludgers away from their team,” reeled off. good,” said wood. have bludgers ever killed anyone?” asked, hoping he sounded offhand. at hogwarts. we’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. now, last member of team is seeker. that’s you. you don’t have to worry about quaffle or bludgers unless they crack my head open.” worry, weasleys are more than a match for bludgers i mean, they’re like a pair of human bludgers themselves.” wood reached into crate took out fourth last ball. compared with quaffle bludgers, it was tiny, about size of a large walnut. it was bright gold had little fluttering silver wings. said wood, golden snitch, it’s most important ball of lot. it’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast difficult to see. it’s seeker’s job to catch it. you’ve got to weave in out of chasers, beaters, bludgers, quaffle to get it before other team’s seeker, because whichever seeker catches snitch wins his team an extra hundred fifty points, so they nearly always win. that’s why seekers get fouled so much. a game of quidditch only ends when snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages i think record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so players could get some sleep. that’s it any questions?” shook his head. he understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be problem. won’t practice with snitch yet,” said wood, carefully shutting it back inside crate, too dark, we might lose it. let’s try you out with a few of these.” he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket a few minutes later, he were up in air, wood throwing golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for to catch. didn’t miss a single one, wood was delighted. after half an hour, night had really fallen they couldn’t carry on. quidditch cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said wood happily as they trudged back up to castle. wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley, he could have played for england if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at hogwarts two months. castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had. his lessons, too, were becoming more more interesting now that they had mastered basics. on halloween morning they woke to delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through corridors. even better, professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make neville’s toad zoom around classroom. professor flitwick put class into pairs to practice. harry’s partner was seamus finnigan (which was a relief, because neville had been trying to catch his eye). ron, however, was to be working with hermione granger. it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this. she hadn’t spoken to either of them since day harry’s broomstick had arrived. don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked professor flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. flick, remember, swish flick. saying magic words properly is very important, too never forget wizard baruffio, who said instead of found himself on floor with a buffalo on his chest.” it was very difficult. seamus swished flicked, but feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on desktop. seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand set fire to it had to put it out with his hat. ron, at next table, wasn’t having much more luck. leviosal” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. saying it wrong,” heard hermione snap. wing-gar-dium levi-o-sa, make nice long.” do it, then, if you’re so clever,” ron snarled. hermione rolled up sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, said, leviosav’ their feather rose off desk hovered about four feet above their heads. well done!” cried professor flitwick, clapping. see here, miss granger’s done it!” ron was in a very bad mood by end of class. no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to as they pushed their way into crowded corridor, a nightmare, honestly.” someone knocked into as they hurried past him. it was hermione. caught a glimpse of her face was startled to see that she was in tears. think she heard you.” said ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” hermione didn’t turn up for next class wasn’t seen all afternoon. on their way down to great hall for halloween feast, ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in girls’ bathroom wanted to be left alone. ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered great hall, where halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds. a thousand live bats fluttered from walls ceiling while a thousand more swooped over tables in low black clouds, making candles in pumpkins stutter. feast appeared suddenly on golden plates, as it had at start-of-term banquet. was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into hall, his turban askew terror on his face. everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore’s chair, slumped against table, gasped, in dungeons thought you ought to know.” he then sank to floor in a dead faint. there was an uproar. it took several purple firecrackers exploding from end of professor dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. he rumbled, your houses back to dormitories immediately!” percy was in his element. me! stick together, first years! no need to fear troll if you follow my orders! stay close behind me, now. make way, first years coming through! excuse me, i’m a prefect!” could a troll get in?” asked as they climbed stairs. ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said ron. peeves let it in for a halloween joke.” they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs, suddenly grabbed ron’s arm. just thought hermione.” about her?” doesn’t know about troll.” ron bit his lip. all right,” he snapped. percy’d better not see us.” ducking down, they joined hufflepuffs going other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, hurried off toward girls’ bathroom. they had just turned corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. hissed ron, pulling behind a large griffin. peering around it, however, they saw not percy but snape. he crossed corridor disappeared from view. he doing?” whispered. isn’t he down in dungeons with rest of teachers?” me.” quietly as possible, they crept along next corridor after snape fading footsteps. heading for third floor,” said, but ron held up his hand. you smell something?” sniffed a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. then they heard it a low grunting, shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. ron pointed at end of a passage to left, something huge was moving toward them. they shrank into shadows watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. it was a horrible sight. twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. smell coming from it was incredible. it was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along floor because its arms were so long. troll stopped next to a doorway peered inside. it waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into room. key’s in lock,” muttered. could lock it in.” idea,” said ron nervously. they edged toward open door, mouths dry, praying troll wasn’t about to come out of it. with one great leap, managed to grab key, slam door, lock it. flushed with their victory, they started to run back up passage, but as they reached corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high, petrified scream it was coming from chamber they’d just chained up. no,” said ron, pale as bloody baron. girls’ bathroom!” gasped. hermionel” they said together. it was last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? wheeling around, they sprinted back to door turned key, fumbling in their panic. pulled door open they ran inside. hermione granger was shrinking against wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. troll was advancing on her, knocking sinks off walls as it went. it!” said desperately to ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against wall. troll stopped a few feet from hermione. it lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made noise. its mean little eyes saw harry. it hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. pea-brain!” yelled ron from other side of chamber, he threw a metal pipe at it. troll didn’t even seem to notice pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard yell paused again, turning its ugly snout toward ron instead, giving time to run around it. on, run, run\\” yelled at hermione, trying to pull her toward door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against wall, her mouth open with terror. shouting echoes seemed to be driving troll berserk. it roared again started toward ron, who was nearest had no way to escape. then did something that was both very brave very stupid: he took a great running jump managed to fasten his arms around troll’s neck from behind. troll couldn’t feel hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped it had gone straight up one of troll’s nostrils. howling with pain, troll twisted flailed its club, with clinging on for dear life; any second, troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with club. hermione had sunk to floor in fright; ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry first spell that came into his head: leviosal” club flew suddenly out of troll’s hand, rose high, high up into air, turned slowly over dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s head. troll swayed on spot then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made whole room tremble. got to his feet. he was shaking out of breath. ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. it was hermione who spoke first. it dead?” don’t think so,” said harry, think it’s just been knocked out.” he bent down pulled his wand out of troll’s nose. it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. troll boogers.” he wiped it on troll’s trousers. a sudden slamming loud footsteps made three of them look up. they hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard crashes troll’s roars. a moment later, professor mcgonagall had come bursting into room, closely followed by snape, with quirrell bringing up rear. quirrell took one look at troll, let out a faint whimper, sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. snape bent over troll. professor mcgonagall was looking at ron harry. had never seen her look so angry. her lips were white. hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harry’s mind. on earth were you thinking of?” said professor mcgonagall, with cold fury in her voice. looked at ron, who was still standing with his wand in air. lucky you weren’t killed. why aren’t you in your dormitory?” snape gave a swift, piercing look. looked at floor. he wished ron would put his wand down. then a small voice came out of shadows. professor mcgonagall they were looking for me.” granger!” hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. went looking for troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know, because i’ve read all about them.” ron dropped his wand. hermione granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? they hadn’t found me, i’d be dead now. stuck his wand up its nose ron knocked it out with its own club. they didn’t have time to come fetch anyone. it was about to finish me off when they arrived.” ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them. in that case ...” said professor mcgonagall, staring at three of them, granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” hermione hung her head. was speechless. hermione was last person to do anything against rules, here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. it was as if snape had started handing out sweets. granger, five points will be taken from gryffindor for this,” said professor mcgonagall. very disappointed in you. if you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to gryffindor tower. students are finishing feast in their houses.” hermione left. professor mcgonagall turned to ron. i still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. you each win gryffindor five points. professor dumbledore will be informed of this. you may go.” they hurried out of chamber didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. it was a relief to be away from smell of troll, quite apart from anything else. should have gotten more than ten points,” ron grumbled. you mean, once she’s taken off hermione of her to get us out of trouble like that,” ron admitted. you, we did save her.” might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked thing in with her,” reminded him. they had reached portrait of fat lady. snout,” they said entered. common room was packed noisy. everyone was eating food that had been sent up. hermione, however, stood alone by door, waiting for them. there was a very embarrassed pause. then, none of them looking at each other, they all said hurried off to get plates. but from that moment on, hermione granger became their friend. there are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. quidditch as they entered november, weather turned very cold. mountains around school became icy gray lake like chilled steel. every morning ground was covered in frost. hagrid could be seen from upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, enormous beaverskin boots. quidditch season had begun. on saturday, would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: gryffindor versus slytherin. if gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in house championship. hardly anyone had seen play because wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, should be kept, well, secret. but news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow, didn’t know which was worse people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. it was really lucky that now had hermione as a friend. he didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all last- minute quidditch practice wood was making them do. she had also lent him quidditch through ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually smallest fastest players, that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing quidditch, referees had been known to vanish turn up months later in sahara desert. hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since ron had saved her from mountain troll, she was much nicer for it. day before harry’s first quidditch match three of them were out in freezing courtyard during break, she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. they were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when snape crossed yard. noticed at once that snape was limping. harry, ron, hermione moved closer together to block fire from view; they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed. unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught snape’s eye. he limped over. he hadn’t seen fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. that you’ve got there, potter?” it was quidditch through ages. showed him. books are not to be taken outside school,” said snape. it to me. five points from gryffindor.” just made that rule up,” muttered angrily as snape limped away. what’s wrong with his leg?” but i hope it’s really hurting him,” said ron bitterly. gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. harry, ron, hermione sat together next to a window. hermione was checking ron’s charms homework for them. she would never let them copy (“how will you learn?”), but by asking her to read it through, they got right answers anyway. felt restless. he wanted quidditch through ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. why should he be afraid of snape? getting up, he told ron hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it. you than me,” they said together, but had an idea that snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening. he made his way down to staffroom knocked. there was no answer. he knocked again. nothing. perhaps snape had left book in there? it was worth a try. he pushed door ajar peered inside a horrible scene met his eyes. snape filch were inside, alone. snape was holding his robes above his knees. one of his legs was bloody mangled. filch was handing snape bandages. thing,” snape was saying. are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” tried to shut door quietly, but snape face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. gulped. just wondered if i could have my book back.” out! out!” left, before snape could take any more points from gryffindor. he sprinted back upstairs. you get it?” ron asked as joined them. matter?” in a low whisper, told them what he’d seen. know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. tried to get past that three-headed dog at halloween! that’s where he was going when we saw him he’s after whatever it’s guarding! i’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!” hermione’s eyes were wide. he wouldn’t,” she said. know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try steal something dumbledore was keeping safe.” hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped ron. with harry. i wouldn’t put anything past snape. but what’s he after? what’s that dog guarding?” went to bed with his head buzzing with same question. neville was snoring loudly, but couldn’t sleep. he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but expression on snape’s face when had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget. next morning dawned very bright cold. great hall was full of delicious smell of fried sausages cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match. got to eat some breakfast.” don’t want anything.” a bit of toast,” wheedled hermione. not hungry.” felt terrible. in an hour’s time he’d be walking onto field. you need your strength,” said seamus finnigan. are always ones who get clobbered by other team.” seamus,” said harry, watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. by eleven o’clock whole school seemed to be out in stands around quidditch pitch. many students had binoculars. seats might be raised high in air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. ron hermione joined neville, seamus, dean west ham fan up in top row. as a surprise for harry, they had painted a large banner on one of sheets scabbers had ruined. it said for president, dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large gryffindor lion underneath. then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that paint flashed different colors. meanwhile, in locker room, rest of team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes (slytherin would be playing in green) . wood cleared his throat for silence. men,” he said. women,” said chaser angelina johnson. women,” wood agreed. is it.” big one,” said fred weasley. one we’ve all been waiting for,” said george. know oliver’s speech by heart,” fred told harry, were on team last year.” up, you two,” said wood. is best team gryffindor’s had in years. we’re going to win. i know it.” he glared at them all as if to say, else.” it’s time. good luck, all of you.” followed fred george out of locker room and, hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto field to loud cheers. madam hooch was refereeing. she stood in middle of field waiting for two teams, her broom in her hand. i want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to slytherin captain, marcus flint, a fifth year. thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. out of corner of his eye he saw fluttering banner high above, flashing for president over crowd. his heart skipped. he felt braver. your brooms, please.” clambered onto his nimbus two thousand. madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into air. they were off. quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is, rather attractive, too professor.” weasley twins’ friend, lee jordan, was doing commentary for match, closely watched by professor mcgonagall. she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to alicia spinnet, a good find of oliver wood’s, last year only a reserve back to johnson no, slytherins have taken quaffle, slytherin captain marcus flint gains quaffle off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there he’s going to

angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score!” gryffindor cheers filled cold air, with howls moans from slytherins. up there, move along.” ron hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them. watchin’ from me hut,” said hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, it isn’t same as bein’ in crowd. no sign of snitch yet, eh?” said ron. hasn’t had much to do yet.” outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said hagrid, raising his binoculars peering skyward at speck that was harry. way up above them, was gliding over game, squinting about for some sign of snitch. this was part of his wood’s game plan. out of way until you catch sight of snitch,” wood had said. don’t want you attacked before you have to be.” when angelina had scored, had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. now he was back to staring around for snitch. once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of weasleys’ wristwatches, once a bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but dodged it fred weasley came chasing after it. right there, harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat bludger furiously toward marcus flint. in possession,” lee jordan was saying, pucey ducks two bludgers, two weasleys, chaser bell, speeds toward wait a moment was that snitch?” a murmur ran through crowd as adrian pucey dropped quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at flash of gold that had passed his left ear. saw it. in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after streak of gold. slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it, too. neck neck they hurtled toward snitch all chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. was faster than higgs he could see little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham! a roar of rage echoed from gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked on purpose, harry’s broom spun off course, holding on for dear life. screamed gryffindors. madam hooch spoke angrily to flint then ordered a free shot at goal posts for gryffindor. but in all confusion, of course, golden snitch had disappeared from sight again. down in stands, dean thomas was yelling, him off, ref! red card!” are you talking about, dean?” said ron. card!” said dean furiously. soccer you get shown red card you’re out of game!” this isn’t soccer, dean,” ron reminded him. hagrid, however, was on dean’s side. oughta change rules. flint coulda knocked outta air.” lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. after that obvious disgusting bit of cheating growled professor mcgonagall. mean, after that open revolting foul i’m warning you right, all right. flint nearly kills gryffindor seeker, which could happen to anyone, i’m sure, so a penalty to gryffindor, taken by spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, we continue play, gryffindor still in possession.” it was as dodged another bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. his broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. for a split second, he thought he was going to fall. he gripped broom tightly with both his hands knees. he’d never felt anything like that. it happened again. it was as though broom was trying to buck him off. but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. tried to turn back toward gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time-out then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. he couldn’t turn it. he couldn’t direct it at all. it was zigzagging through air, every now then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. lee was still commentating. in possession flint with quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in face by a bludger, hope it broke his nose only joking, professor slytherins score oh no ...” slytherins were cheering. no one seemed to have noticed that harry’s broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher, away from game, jerking twitching as it went. what thinks he’s doing,” hagrid mumbled. he stared through his binoculars. i didn’ know better, i’d say he’d lost control of his broom ... but he can’t have. ...” suddenly, people were pointing up at all over stands. his broom had started to roll over over, with him only just managing to hold on. then whole crowd gasped. harry’s broom had given a wild jerk swung off it. he was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. something happen to it when flint blocked him?” seamus whispered. have,” hagrid said, his voice shaking. nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand.” at these words, hermione seized hagrid binoculars, but instead of looking up at harry, she started looking frantically at crowd. are you doing?” moaned ron, gray-faced. knew it,” hermione gasped, look.” ron grabbed binoculars. snape was in middle of stands opposite them. he had his eyes fixed on was muttering nonstop under his breath. doing something jinxing broom,” said hermione. should we do?” it to me.” before ron could say another word, hermione had disappeared. ron turned binoculars back on harry. his broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as weasleys flew up to try pull safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good every time they got near him, broom would jump higher still. they dropped lower circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. marcus flint seized quaffle scored five times without anyone noticing. on, hermione,” ron muttered desperately. hermione had fought her way across to stand where snape stood, was now racing along row behind him; she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into row in front. reaching snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, whispered a few, well-chosen words. bright blue flames shot from her wand onto hem of snape robes. it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire. a sudden yelp told her she had done her job. scooping fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along row snape would never know what had happened. it was enough. up in air, was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. you can look!” ron said. neville had been sobbing into hagrid’s jacket for last five minutes. was speeding toward ground when crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit field on all fours coughed something gold fell into his hand. got snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, game ended in complete confusion. didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference hadn’t broken any rules lee jordan was still happily shouting results gryffindor had won by one hundred seventy points to sixty. heard none of this, though. he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid’s hut, with ron hermione. was snape,” ron was explaining, i saw him. he was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.” said hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in stands. would snape do somethin’ like that?” harry, ron, hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. decided on truth. found out something about him,” he told hagrid. tried to get past that three-headed dog on halloween. it bit him. we think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” hagrid dropped teapot. do you know about fluffy?” he said. fluffy ?” he’s mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in pub las’ year i lent him to dumbledore to guard said eagerly. don’t ask me anymore,” said hagrid gruffly. top secret, that is.” snape’s trying to steal it.” said hagrid again. a hogwarts teacher, he’d do nothin’ of sort.” why did he just try kill harry?” cried hermione. afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape. know a jinx when i see one, hagrid, i’ve read all about them! you’ve got to keep eye contact, snape wasn’t blinking at all, i saw him!” tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said hagrid hotly. don’ know why harry’s broom acted like that, but snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! now, listen to me, all three of yeh yer meddlin’ in things that don’ concern yeh. it’s dangerous. you forget that dog, an’ you forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between professor dumbledore an’ nicolas flamel said harry, there’s someone called nicolas flamel involved, is there?” hagrid looked furious with himself. mirror of erised christmas was coming. one morning in mid- december, hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. lake froze solid weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around, bouncing off back of his turban. few owls that managed to battle their way through stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again. no one could wait for holidays to start. while gryffindor common room great hall had roaring fires, drafty corridors had become icy a bitter wind rattled windows in classrooms. worst of all were professor snape’s classes down in dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. do feel so sorry,” said draco malfoy, one potions class, all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they’re not wanted at home.” he was looking over at as he spoke. crabbe goyle chuckled. harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-fish, ignored them. malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since quidditch match. disgusted that slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing as seeker next. then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at way had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. so malfoy, jealous angry, had gone back to taunting about having no proper family. it was true that wasn’t going back to privet drive for christmas. professor mcgonagall had come around week before, making a list of students who would be staying for holidays, had signed up at once. he didn’t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be best christmas he’d ever had. ron his brothers were staying, too, because mr. mrs. weasley were going to romania to visit charlie. when they left dungeons at end of potions, they found a large fir tree blocking corridor ahead. two enormous feet sticking out at bottom a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it. hagrid, want any help?” ron asked, sticking his head through branches. i’m all right, thanks, ron.” you mind moving out of way?” came malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them. you trying to earn some extra money, weasley? hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts, i suppose that hut of hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to.” ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up stairs. ron let go of front of malfoy’s robes. was provoked, professor snape,” said hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind tree. was insultin’ his family.” that as it may, fighting is against hogwarts rules, hagrid,” said snape silkily. points from gryffindor, weasley, be grateful it isn’t more. move along, all of you.” malfoy, crabbe, goyle pushed roughly past tree, scattering needles everywhere smirking. get him,” said ron, grinding his teeth at malfoy’s back, of these days, i’ll get him hate them both,” said harry, snape.” on, cheer up, it’s nearly christmas,” said hagrid. yeh what, come with me an’ see great hall, looks a treat.” so three of them followed hagrid his tree off to great hall, where professor mcgonagall professor flitwick were busy with christmas decorations. hagrid, last tree put it in far corner, would you?” hall looked spectacular. festoons of holly mistletoe hung all around walls, no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. many days you got left until yer holidays?” hagrid asked. one,” said hermione. that reminds me harry, ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in library.” yeah, you’re right,” said ron, tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand was trailing them over branches of new tree. library?” said hagrid, following them out of hall. before holidays? bit keen, aren’t yeh?” we’re not working,” told him brightly. since you mentioned nicolas flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.” what?” hagrid looked shocked. here i’ve told yeh drop it. it’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” just want to know who nicolas flamel is, that’s all,” said hermione. you’d like to tell us save us trouble?” added. must’ve been through hundreds of books already we can’t find him anywhere just give us a hint i know i’ve read his name somewhere.” sayin’ nothin’,” said hagrid flatly. have to find out for ourselves, then,” said ron, they left hagrid looking disgruntled hurried off to library. they had indeed been searching books for flamel’s name ever since hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal? trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book. he wasn’t in great wizards of twentieth century, or notable magical names of our time he was missing, too, from important modern magical discoveries, a study of recent developments in wizardry. then, of course, there was sheer size of library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. hermione took out a list of subjects titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books started pulling them off shelves at random. wandered over to restricted section. he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of teachers to look in any of restricted books, he knew he’d never get one. these were books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts, only read by older students studying advanced defense against dark arts. are you looking for, boy?” said harry. madam pince librarian brandished a feather duster at him. better get out, then. go on out!” wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, left library. he, ron, hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel. they were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk snape hearing what they were up to. waited outside in corridor to see if other two had found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. they had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing. what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks. five minutes later, ron hermione joined him, shaking their heads. they went off to lunch. will keep looking while i’m away, won’t you?” said hermione. send me an owl if you find anything.” you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is,” said ron. be safe to ask them.” safe, as they’re both dentists,” said hermione. once holidays had started, ron were having too good a time to think much about flamel. they had dormitory to themselves common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get good armchairs by fire. they sat by hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread, english muffins, marshmallows plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work. ron also started teaching wizard chess. this was exactly like muggle chess except that figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. ron’s set was very old battered. like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case, his grandfather. however, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him, they didn’t trust him at all. he wasn’t a very good player yet they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. send me there, can’t you see his knight? send him, we can afford to lose him.” on christmas eve, went to bed looking forward to next day for food fun, but not expecting any presents at all. when he woke early in morning, however, first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at foot of his bed. christmas,” said ron sleepily as scrambled out of bed pulled on his bathrobe. too,” said harry. you look at this? i’ve got some presents!” did you expect, turnips?” said ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than harry’s. picked up top parcel. it was wrapped in thick brown paper scrawled across it was to harry, from hagrid. inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. blew it it sounded a bit like an owl. a second, very small parcel contained a note. we received your message enclose your christmas present. from uncle vernon aunt petunia. taped to note was a fifty-pence piece. friendly,” said harry. ron was fascinated by fifty pence. weird\\ he said, a shape! this is money?” can keep it,” said harry, laughing at how pleased ron was. my aunt uncle so who sent these?” think i know who that one’s from,” said ron, turning a bit pink pointing to a very lumpy parcel. mom. i told her you didn’t expect any presents oh, no,” he groaned, made you a weasley sweater.” had torn open parcel to find a thick, hand- knitted sweater in emerald green a large box of homemade fudge. year she makes us a sweater,” said ron, unwrapping his own, mine’s always maroon.” really nice of her,” said harry, trying fudge, which was very tasty. his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione. this only left one parcel. picked it up felt it. it was very light. he unwrapped it. something fluid silvery gray went slithering to floor where it lay in gleaming folds. ron gasped. heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping box of every flavor beans he’d gotten from hermione. that’s what i think it is they’re really rare, really valuable.” is it?” picked shining, silvery cloth off floor. it was strange to touch, like water woven into material. an invisibility cloak,” said ron, a look of awe on his face. sure it is try it on.” threw cloak around his shoulders ron gave a yell. is! look down!” looked down at his feet, but they were gone. he dashed to mirror. sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. he pulled cloak over his head his reflection vanished completely. a note!” said ron suddenly. note fell out of it!” pulled off cloak seized letter. written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were following words: your father left this in my possession before he died. it is time it was returned to you. use it well. a very merry christmas to you. there was no signature. stared at note. ron was admiring cloak. give anuthinq for one of these,” he said. what’s matter?” said harry. he felt very strange. who had sent cloak? had it really once belonged to his father? before he could say or think anything else, dormitory door was flung open fred george weasley bounded in. stuffed cloak quickly out of sight. he didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. christmas!” look harry’s got a weasley sweater, too!” fred george were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow f on it, other a g. is better than ours, though,” said fred, holding up harry’s sweater. obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family.” aren’t you wearing yours, ron?” george demanded. on, get it on, they’re lovely warm.” hate maroon,” ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. haven’t got a letter on yours,” george observed. suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name. but we’re not stupid we know we’re called gred forge.” all this noise?” percy weasley stuck his head through door, looking disapproving. he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which fred seized. for prefect! get it on, percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, even got one.” don’t want said percy thickly, as twins forced sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. you’re not sitting with prefects today, either,” said george. is a time for family.” they frog-marched percy from room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner. a hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy cranberry sauce stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along table. these fantastic party favors were nothing like feeble muggle ones dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys their flimsy paper hats inside. pulled a wizard cracker with fred it didn’t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat several live, white mice. up at high table, dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him. flaming christmas puddings followed turkey. percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. watched hagrid getting redder redder in face as he called for more wine, finally kissing professor mcgonagall on cheek, who, to harry’s amazement, giggled blushed, her top hat lopsided. when finally left table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of crackers, including a pack of non-explodable, luminous balloons, a grow- your-own-warts kit, his own new wizard chess set. white mice had disappeared had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs. norris’s christmas dinner. weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on grounds. then, cold, wet, gasping for breath, they returned to fire in gryffindor common room, where broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron. he suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if percy hadn’t tried to help him so much. after a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, christmas cake, everyone felt too full sleepy to do much before bed except sit watch percy chase fred george all over gryffindor tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge. it had been harry’s best christmas day ever. yet something had been nagging at back of his mind all day. not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: invisibility cloak whoever had sent it. ron, full of turkey cake with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn curtains of his four-poster. leaned over side of his own bed pulled cloak out from under it. his father’s ... this had been his father’s. he let material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. use it well, note had said. he had to try it, now. he slipped out of bed wrapped cloak around himself. looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight shadows. it was a very funny feeling. use it well. suddenly, felt wide-awake. whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. excitement flooded through him as he stood there in dark silence. he could go anywhere in this, anywhere, filch would never know. ron grunted in his sleep. should wake him? something held him back his father’s cloak he felt that this time first time he wanted to use it alone. he crept out of dormitory, down stairs, across common room, climbed through portrait hole. there?” squawked fat lady. said nothing. he walked quickly down corridor. where should he go? he stopped, his heart racing, thought. then it came to him. restricted section in library. he’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who flamel was. he set off, drawing invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. library was pitch-black very eerie. lit a lamp to see his way along rows of books. lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, even though could feel his arm supporting it, sight gave him creeps. restricted section was right at back of library. stepping carefully over rope that separated these books from rest of library, he held up his lamp to read titles. they didn’t tell him much. their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages couldn’t understand. some had no title at all. one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. hairs on back of harry’s neck prickled. maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be. he had to start somewhere. setting lamp down carefully on floor, he looked along bottom shelf for an interesting-looking book. a large black silver volume caught his eye. he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split silence book was screaming! snapped it shut, but shriek went on on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. he stumbled backward knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. panicking, he heard footsteps coming down corridor outside stuffing shrieking book back on shelf, he ran for it. he passed filch in doorway; filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, slipped under filch’s outstretched arm streaked off up corridor, book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears. he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. he had been so busy getting away from library, he hadn’t paid attention to where he was going. perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all. there was a suit of armor near kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. asked me to come directly to you, professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, somebody’s been in library restricted section.” felt blood drain out of his face. wherever he was, filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, to his horror, it was snape who replied, restricted section? well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” stood rooted to spot as filch snape came around corner ahead. they couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor if they came much nearer they’d knock right into him cloak didn’t stop him from being solid. he backed away as quietly as he could. a door stood ajar to his left. it was his only hope. he squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, to his relief he managed to get inside room without their noticing anything. they walked straight past, leaned against wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. that had been close, very close. it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about room he had hidden in. it looked like an unused classroom. dark shapes of desks chairs were piled against walls, there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of way. it was a magnificent mirror, as high as ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. there was an inscription carved around top: erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch snape, moved nearer to mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. he stepped in front of it. he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. he whirled around. his heart was pounding far more furiously than when book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. but room was empty. breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to mirror. there he was, reflected in it, white scared- looking, there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. looked over his shoulder but still, no one was there. or were they all invisible, too? was he in fact in a room full of invisible people this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? he looked in mirror again. a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him waving. he reached out a hand felt air behind him. if she was really there, he’d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air she others existed only in mirror. she was a very pretty woman. she had dark red hair her eyes her eyes are just like mine, thought, edging a little closer to glass. bright green exactly same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at same time. tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. he wore glasses, his hair was very untidy. it stuck up at back, just as harry’s did. was so close to mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. he whispered. they just looked at him, smiling. slowly, looked into faces of other people in mirror, saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had harry’s knobbly knees was looking at his family, for first time in his life. potters smiled waved at he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it reach them. he had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. how long he stood there, he didn’t know. reflections did not fade he looked looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. he couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. he tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, come back,” hurried from room. could have woken me up,” said ron, crossly. can come tonight, i’m going back, i want to show you mirror.” like to see your mom dad,” ron said eagerly. i want to see all your family, all weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers everyone.” can see them any old time,” said ron. come round my house this summer. anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. shame about not finding flamel, though. have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating anything?” couldn’t eat. he had seen his parents would be seeing them again tonight. he had almost forgotten about flamel. it didn’t seem very important anymore. who cared what three-headed dog was guarding? what did it matter if snape stole it, really? you all right?” said ron. look odd.” what feared most was that he might not be able to find mirror room again. with ron covered in cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly next night. they tried retracing harry’s route from library, wandering around dark passageways for nearly an hour. freezing,” said ron. forget it go back.” hissed. know it’s here somewhere.” they passed ghost of a tall witch gliding in opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, spotted suit of armor. here just here yes!” they pushed door open. dropped cloak from around his shoulders ran to mirror. there they were. his mother father beamed at sight of him. whispered. can’t see anything.” look at them all ... there are loads of them. ...” can only see you.” in it properly, go on, stand where i am.” stepped aside, but with ron in front of mirror, he couldn’t see his family anymore, just ron in his paisley pajamas. ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. at me!” he said. you see all your family standing around you?” i’m alone but i’m different i look older i’m head boy!” am i’m wearing badge like bill used to i’m holding house cup quidditch cup i’m quidditch captain, too!” ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry. you think this mirror shows future?” can it? all my family are dead let me have another look had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” only holding quidditch cup, what’s interesting about that? i want to see my parents.” push me a sudden noise outside in corridor put an end to their discussion. they hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking. ron threw cloak back over them as luminous eyes of mrs. norris came round door. ron stood quite still, both thinking same thing did cloak work on cats? after what seemed an age, she turned left. isn’t safe she might have gone for filch, i bet she heard us. come on.” ron pulled out of room. snow still hadn’t melted next morning. to play chess, harry?” said ron. don’t we go down visit hagrid?” ... you go ...” know what you’re thinking about, harry, that mirror. don’t go back tonight.” not?” dunno, i’ve just got a bad feeling about it anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. filch, snape, mrs. norris are wandering around. so what if they can’t see you? what if they walk into you? what if you knock something over?” sound like hermione.” serious, harry, don’t go.” but only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of mirror, ron wasn’t going to stop him. that third night he found his way more quickly than before. he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn’t meet anyone. there were his mother father smiling at him again, one of his grandfathers nodding happily. sank down to sit on floor in front of mirror. there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. nothing at all. except back again, harry?” felt as though his insides had turned to ice. he looked behind him. sitting on one of desks by wall was none other than albus dumbledore. must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to mirror he hadn’t noticed him. i didn’t see you, sir.” how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said dumbledore, was relieved to see that he was smiling. said dumbledore, slipping off desk to sit on floor with harry, like hundreds before you, have discovered delights of mirror of erised.” didn’t know it was called that, sir.” i expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” well it shows me my family it showed your friend ron himself as head boy.” did you know ?” don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said dumbledore gently. can you think what mirror of erised shows us all?” shook his head. me explain. happiest man on earth would be able to use mirror of erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it see himself exactly as he is. does that help?” thought. then he said slowly, shows us what we want ... whatever we want ...” no,” said dumbledore quietly. shows us nothing more or less than deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. you, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. ronald weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, best of all of them. however, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, harry, i ask you not to go looking for it again. if you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. it does not do to dwell on dreams forget to live, remember that. now, why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on get off to bed?” stood up. professor dumbledore? can i ask you something?” you’ve just done so,” dumbledore smiled. may ask me one more thing, however.” do you see when you look in mirror?” i see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” stared. can never have enough socks,” said dumbledore. christmas has come gone i didn’t get a single pair. people will insist on giving me books.” it was only when he was back in bed that it struck that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. but then, he thought, as he shoved scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question. nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced not to go looking for mirror of erised again, for rest of christmas holidays invisibility cloak stayed folded at bottom of his trunk. wished he could forget what he’d seen in mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. he started having nightmares. over over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. see, dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said ron, when told him about these dreams. hermione, who came back day before term started, took a different view of things. she was torn between horror at idea of being out of bed, roaming school three nights in a row (“if filch had caught you!”), disappointment that he hadn’t at least found out who nicolas flamel was. they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book, even though was still sure he’d read name somewhere. once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. had even less time than other two, because quidditch practice had started again. wood was working team harder than ever. even endless rain that had replaced snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic, but was on wood’s side. if they won their next match, against hufflepuff, they would overtake slytherin in house championship for first time in seven years. quite apart from wanting to win, found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. then, during one particularly wet muddy practice session, wood gave team a bit of bad news. he’d just gotten very angry with weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other pretending to fall off their brooms. you stop messing around!” he yelled. exactly sort of thing that’ll lose us match! snape’s refereeing this time, he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor!” george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. he ever refereed a quidditch match? he’s not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin.” rest of team landed next to george to complain, too. not my fault,” said wood. just got to make sure we play a clean game, so snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.” which was all very well, thought harry, but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch. ... rest of team hung back to talk to one another as usual at end of practice, but headed straight back to gryffindor common room, where he found ron hermione playing chess. chess was only thing hermione ever lost at, something ron thought was very good for her. talk to me for a moment,” said ron when sat down next to him, need to concern” he caught sight of harry’s face. matter with you? you look terrible.” speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, told other two about snape sudden, sinister desire to be a quidditch referee. play,” said hermione at once. you’re ill,” said ron. to break your leg,” hermione suggested. really break your leg,” said ron. can’t,” said harry. isn’t a reserve seeker. if i back out, gryffindor can’t play at all.” at that moment neville toppled into common room. how he had managed to climb through portrait hole was anyone’s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as leg-locker curse. he must have had to bunny hop all way up to gryffindor tower. everyone fell over laughing except hermione, who leapt up performed countercurse. neville’s legs sprang apart he got to his feet, trembling. happened?” hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with ron. said neville shakily. met him outside library. he said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.” to professor mcgonagall!” hermione urged neville. him!” neville shook his head. don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. got to stand up to him, neville!” said ron. used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him make it easier.” no need to tell me i’m not brave enough to be in gryffindor, malfoy’s already done that,” neville choked out. felt in pocket of his robes pulled out a chocolate frog, very last one from box hermione had given him for christmas. he gave it to neville, who looked as though he might cry. worth twelve of malfoy,” said. sorting hat chose you for gryffindor, didn’t it? where’s malfoy? in stinking slytherin.” neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped frog. ... i think i’ll go to bed. ... d’you want card, you collect them, don’t you?” as neville walked away, looked at famous wizard card. again,” he said, was first one i ever he gasped. he stared at back of card. then he looked up at ron hermione. found him\\” he whispered. found flamel! i told you i’d read name somewhere before, i read it on train coming here listen to this: is particularly famous for his defeat of dark wizard grindelwald in for discovery of twelve uses of dragon’s blood, his work on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel’v’ hermione jumped to her feet. she hadn’t looked so excited since they’d gotten back marks for their very first piece of homework. there!” she said, she sprinted up stairs to girls’ dormitories. ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. got this out of library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” said ron, but hermione told him to be quiet until she’d looked something up, started flicking frantically through pages, muttering to herself. at last she found what she was looking for. knew it! i knew it!” we allowed to speak yet?” said ron grumpily. hermione ignored him. flamel,” she whispered dramatically, only known maker of sorcerer’s stone\\” this didn’t have quite effect she’d expected. what?” said ron. honestly , don’t you two read? look read that, there.” she pushed book toward them, ron read: ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making sorcerer’s stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. will transform any metal into pure gold. it also produces elixir of life, which will make drinker immortal. there have been many reports of sorcerer’s over centuries, but only currently in existence belongs to mr. nicolas flamel, noted alchemist opera lover. mr. flamel, who celebrated his six hundred sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife, perenelle (six hundred fifty-eight). said hermione, when ron had finished. dog must be guarding flamel’s sorcerer’s stone! i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted moved out of gringotts!” that makes gold stops you from ever dying!” said harry. wonder snape’s after it! anyone would want it.” no wonder we couldn’t find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry,” said ron. not exactly recent if he’s six hundred sixty-five, is he?” next morning in defense against dark arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, ron were still discussing what they’d do with a sorcerer’s if they had one. it wasn’t until ron said he’d buy his own quidditch team that remembered about snape coming match. going to play,” he told ron hermione. i don’t, all slytherins will think i’m just too scared to face snape. i’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe smiles off their faces if we win.” as long as we’re not wiping you off field,” said hermione. as match drew nearer, however, became more more nervous, whatever he told ron hermione. rest of team wasn’t too calm, either. idea of overtaking slytherin in house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went. at times, he even wondered whether snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, snape was so horrible to harry. could snape possibly know they’d found out about sorcerer’s stone? didn’t see how he could yet he sometimes had horrible feeling that snape could read minds. knew, when they wished him good luck outside locker rooms next afternoon, that ron hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. this wasn’t what you’d call comforting. hardly heard a word of wood’s pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes picked up his nimbus two thousand. ron hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in stands next to neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim worried, or why they had both brought their wands to match. little did know that ron hermione had been secretly practicing leg-locker curse. they’d gotten idea from malfoy using it on neville, were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry. don’t forget, it’s locomotor mortis,” hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. know,” ron snapped. nag.” back in locker room, wood had taken aside. want to pressure you, potter, but if we ever need an early capture of snitch it’s now. finish game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much.” whole school’s out there!” said fred weasley, peering out of door. blimey dumbledore’s come to watch!” harry’s heart did a somersault. he said, dashing to door to make sure. fred was right. there was no mistaking that silver beard. could have laughed out loud with relief. he was safe. there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching. perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as teams marched onto field, something that ron noticed, too. never seen snape look so mean,” he told hermione. they’re off. ouch!” someone had poked ron in back of head. it was malfoy. sorry, weasley, didn’t see you there.” malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe goyle. how long potter’s going to stay on his broom this time? anyone want a bet? what about you, weasley?” ron didn’t answer; snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him. hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at harry, who was circling game like a hawk, looking for snitch. know how i think they choose people for gryffindor team?” said malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. people they feel sorry for. see, there’s potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s weasleys, who’ve got no money you should be on team, longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy. worth twelve of you, malfoy,” he stammered. malfoy, crabbe, goyle howled with laughter, but ron, still not daring to take his eyes from game, said, tell him, neville.” if brains were gold you’d be poorer than weasley, that’s saying something.” ron’s nerves were already stretched to breaking point with anxiety about harry. warning you, malfoy one more word said hermione suddenly, !” where?” had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps cheers from crowd. hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as streaked toward ground like a bullet. in luck, weasley, potter’s obviously spotted some money on ground!” said malfoy. ron snapped. before malfoy knew what was happening, ron was on top of him, wrestling him to ground. neville hesitated, then clambered over back of his seat to help. on, harry!” hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as sped straight at snape she didn’t even notice malfoy ron rolling around under her seat, or scuffles yelps coming from whirl of fists that was neville, crabbe, goyle. up in air, snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches next second, had pulled out of dive, his arm raised in triumph, snitch clasped in his hand. stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember snitch being caught so quickly. ron! where are you? game’s over! harry’s won! we’ve won! gryffindor is in lead!” shrieked hermione, dancing up down on her seat hugging parvati patil in row in front. jumped off his broom, a foot from ground. he couldn’t believe it. he’d done it game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. as gryffindors came spilling onto field, he saw snape land nearby, white-faced tight-lipped then felt a hand on his shoulder looked up into dumbledore’s smiling face. done,” said dumbledore quietly, so that only could hear. to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror . . . been keeping busy . . . excellent ...” snape spat bitterly on ground. jc jc jc left locker room alone some time later, to take his nimbus two thousand back to broomshed. he couldn’t ever remember feeling happier. he’d really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more. evening air had never smelled so sweet. he walked over damp grass, reliving last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; ron hermione in distance, jumping up down, ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. had reached shed. he leaned against wooden door looked up at hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in setting sun. gryffindor in lead. he’d done it, he’d shown snape. ... speaking of snape . . . a hooded figure came swiftly down front steps of castle. clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward forbidden forest. harry’s victory faded from his mind as he watched. he recognized figure’s prowling walk. snape, sneaking into forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on? jumped back on his nimbus two thousand took off. gliding silently over castle he saw snape enter forest at a run. he followed. trees were so thick he couldn’t see where snape had gone. he flew in circles, lower lower, brushing top branches of trees until he heard voices. he glided toward them landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. he climbed carefully along one of branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through leaves. below, in a shadowy clearing, stood snape, but he wasn’t alone. quirrell was there, too. couldn’t make out look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. strained to catch what they were saying. \"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, severus ...” i thought we’d keep this private,” said snape, his voice icy. aren’t supposed to know about sorcerer’s stone, after all.” leaned forward. quirrell was mumbling something. snape interrupted him. you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid’s yet?” severus, i don’t want me as your enemy, quirrell,” said snape, taking a step toward him. don’t know what you know perfectly well what i mean.” an owl hooted loudly, nearly fell out of tree. he steadied himself in time to hear snape say, your little bit of hocus-pocus. i’m waiting.” i d-d-don’t well,” snape cut in. have another little chat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over decided where your loyalties lie.” he threw his cloak over his head strode out of clearing. it was almost dark now, but could see quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. jc jc jc where have you been?” hermione squeaked. won! you won! we won!” shouted ron, thumping on back. i gave malfoy a black eye, neville tried to take on crabbe goyle single- handed! he’s still out cold but madam pomfrey says he’ll be all right talk about showing slytherin! everyone’s waiting for you in common room, we’re having a party, fred george stole some cakes stuff from kitchens.” mind that now,” said breathlessly. find an empty room, you wait you hear this. ...” he made sure peeves wasn’t inside before shutting door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen heard. we were right, it is sorcerer’s stone, snape’s trying to force quirrell to help him get it. he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy he said something about quirrell’s i reckon there are other things guarding apart from fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, quirrell would have done some anti-dark arts spell that snape needs to break through you mean stone’s only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape?” said hermione in alarm. be gone by next tuesday,” said ron. norbert norwegian ridgeback quirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. in weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler thinner, but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet. every time they passed third-floor corridor, harry, ron, hermione would press their ears to door to check that fluffy was still growling inside. snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that was still safe. whenever passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell’s stutter. hermione, however, had more on her mind than sorcerer’s stone. she had started drawing up study schedules color-coding all her notes. ron wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do same. exams are ages away.” weeks,” hermione snapped. not ages, that’s like a second to nicolas flamel.” we’re not six hundred years old,” ron reminded her. what are you studying for, you already know it all.” am i studying for? are you crazy? you realize we need to pass these exams to get into second year? they’re very important, i should have started studying a month ago, i don’t know what’s gotten into me.” unfortunately, teachers seemed to be thinking along same lines as hermione. they piled so much homework on them that easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as christmas ones. it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements. moaning yawning, ron spent most of their free time in library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. never remember this,” ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill looking longingly out of library window. it was first really fine day they’d had in months. sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, there was a feeling in air of summer coming. harry, who was looking up in one thousand magical herbs fungi, didn’t look up until he heard ron say, what are you doing in library?” hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. what’re you lot up ter?” he looked suddenly suspicious. not still lookin’ fer nicolas flamel, are yeh?” we found out who he is ages ago,” said ron impressively. we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a sorcerer’s st hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. go shoutin’ about it, what’s matter with yeh?” are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,” said harry, what’s guarding apart from fluffy said hagrid again. come an’ see me later, i’m not promisin’ i’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. they’ll think i’ve told yeh you later, then,” said harry. hagrid shuffled off. was he hiding behind his back?” said hermione thoughtfully. you think it had anything to do with stone?” going to see what section he was in,” said ron, who’d had enough of working. he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms slammed them down on table. he whispered. was looking up stuff about dragons! look at these: dragon species of great britain ireland; from egg to inferno, a dragon keeper’s guide.” always wanted a dragon, he told me so first time i ever met him,” said harry. it’s against our laws,” said ron. breeding was outlawed by warlocks’ convention of everyone knows that. it’s hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in back garden anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. you should see burns charlie’s got off wild ones in romania.” there aren’t wild dragons in britain?” said harry. course there are,” said ron. welsh green hebridean blacks. ministry of magic has a job hushing them up, i can tell you. our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them forget.” what on earth’s hagrid up to?” said hermione. when they knocked on door of gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all curtains were closed. hagrid called is it?” before he let them in, then shut door quickly behind them. it was stifling hot inside. even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in grate. hagrid made them tea offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” said harry. there was no point beating around bush. were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding sorcerer’s apart from fluffy.” hagrid frowned at him. course i can’t,” he said. one, i don’ know meself. number two, yeh know too much already, so i wouldn’ tell yeh if i could. that stone’s here fer a good reason. it was almost stolen outta gringotts i s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? beats me how yeh even know abou’ fluffy.” come on, hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said hermione in a warm, flattering voice. hagrid beard twitched they could tell he was smiling. only wondered who had done guarding, really.” hermione went on. wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.” hagrid chest swelled at these last words. ron beamed at hermione. i don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... let’s see ... he borrowed fluffy from me ... then some o’ teachers did enchantments ... professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers, quirrell an’ dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. hang on, i’ve forgotten someone. oh yeah, professor snape.” yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? look, snape helped protect stone, he’s not about ter steal it.” knew ron hermione were thinking same as he was. if snape had been in on protecting stone, it must have been easy to find out how other teachers had guarded it. he probably knew everything except, it seemed, quirrell’s spell how to get past fluffy. only one who knows how to get past fluffy, aren’t you, hagrid?” said anxiously. you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? not even one of teachers?” a soul knows except me an’ dumbledore,” said hagrid proudly. that’s something,” muttered to others. can we have a window open? i’m boiling.” harry, sorry,” said hagrid. noticed him glance at fire. looked at it, too. what’s that?” but he already knew what it was. in very heart of fire, underneath kettle, was a huge, black egg. said hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, er ...” did you get it, hagrid?” said ron, crouching over fire to get a closer look at egg. must’ve cost you a fortune.” it,” said hagrid. night. i was down in village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said hermione. i’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. this outta library dragon breeding for pleasure profit it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but it’s all in here. keep egg in fire, their mothers breathe on see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. an’ see here how ter recognize diff’rent eggs what i got there’s a norwegian ridge-back. they’re rare, them.” he looked very pleased with himself, but hermione didn’t. you live in a wooden house,” she said. but hagrid wasn’t listening. he was humming merrily as he stoked fire. so now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all extra homework they were getting. hermione had now started making study schedules for ron, too. it was driving them nuts. then, one breakfast time, hedwig brought another note from hagrid. he had written only two words: it’s hatching. ron wanted to skip herbology go straight down to hut. hermione wouldn’t hear of it. how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?” got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, that’s nothing to what hagrid going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing up!” whispered. malfoy was only a few feet away he had stopped dead to listen. how much had he heard? didn’t like look on malfoy’s face at all. ron hermione argued all way to herbology in end, hermione agreed to run down to hagrid’s with other two during morning break. when bell sounded from castle at end of their lesson, three of them dropped their trowels at once hurried through grounds to edge of forest. hagrid greeted them, looking flushed excited. nearly out.” he ushered them inside. egg was lying on table. there were deep cracks in it. something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. they all drew their chairs up to table watched with bated breath. all at once there was a scraping noise egg split open. baby dragon flopped onto table. it wasn’t exactly pretty; thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, stubs of horns bulging, orange eyes. it sneezed. a couple of sparks flew out of its snout. he beautiful?” hagrid murmured. he reached out a hand to stroke dragon’s head. it snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. him, look, he knows his mommy!” said hagrid. said hermione, fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow, exactly?” hagrid was about to answer when color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet ran to window. matter?” was lookin’ through gap in curtains it’s a kid he’s runnin’ back up ter school.” bolted to door looked out. even at a distance there was no mistaking him. malfoy had seen dragon. something about smile lurking on malfoy’s face during next week made harry, ron, hermione very nervous. they spent most of their free time in hagrid darkened hut, trying to reason with him. let him go,” urged. him free.” can’t,” said hagrid. too little. he’d die.” they looked at dragon. it had grown three times in length in just a week. smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping duties because dragon was keeping him so busy. there were empty brandy bottles chicken feathers all over floor. decided to call him norbert,” said hagrid, looking at dragon with misty eyes. really knows me now, watch. norbert! norbert! where’s mommy?” lost his marbles,” ron muttered in harry’s ear. said loudly, it two weeks norbert’s going to be as long as your house. malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment.” hagrid bit his lip. i know i can’t keep him forever, but i can’t jus’ dump him, can’t.” suddenly turned to ron. he said. losing it, too,” said ron. ron, remember?” charlie your brother, charlie. in romania. studying dragons. we could send norbert to him. charlie can take care of him then put him back in wild!” said ron. about it, hagrid?” in end, hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him. following week dragged by. wednesday night found hermione sitting alone in common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. clock on wall had just chimed midnight when portrait hole burst open. ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harry’s invisibility cloak. he had been down at hagrid’s hut, helping him feed norbert, who was now eating dead rats by crate. bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. i tell you, that dragon’s most horrible animal i’ve ever met, but way hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. when it bit me he told me off for frightening it. when i left, he was singing it a lullaby.” there was a tap on dark window. hedwig!” said harry, hurrying to let her in. have charlie’s answer!” three of them put their heads together to read note. dear ron, how are you? thanks for letter i’d be glad to take norwegian ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. i think best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. could you get ridgeback up tallest tower at midnight on saturday? they can meet you there take him away while it’s still dark. send me an answer as soon as possible. love, charlie they looked at one another. got invisibility cloak,” said harry. shouldn’t be too difficult i think cloak’s big enough to cover two of us norbert.” it was a mark of how bad last week had been that other two agreed with him. anything to get rid of norbert malfoy. there was a hitch. by next morning, ron’s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. he didn’t know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite? by afternoon, though, he had no choice. cut had turned a nasty shade of green. it looked as if norbert’s fangs were poisonous. hermione rushed up to hospital wing at end of day to find ron in a terrible state in bed. not just my hand,” he whispered, that feels like it’s about to fall off. malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come have a good laugh at me. he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me i’ve told her it was a dog, but i don’t think she believes me i shouldn’t have hit him at quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.” hermione tried to calm ron down. all be over at midnight on saturday,” said hermione, but this didn’t soothe ron at all. on contrary, he sat bolt upright broke into a sweat. on saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. no oh no i’ve just remembered charlie’s letter was in that book malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of norbert.” hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. madam pomfrey came over at that moment made them leave, saying ron needed sleep. too late to change plan now,” told hermione. haven’t got time to send charlie another owl, this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert. we’ll have to risk it. we have got invisibility cloak, malfoy doesn’t know about that.” they found fang boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. won’t let you in,” he puffed. at a tricky stage nothin’ i can’t handle.” when they told him about charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on leg. it’s all right, he only got my boot jus’ playin’ he’s only a baby, after all.” baby banged its tail on wall, making windows rattle. hermione walked back to castle feeling saturday couldn’t come quickly enough. they would have felt sorry for hagrid when time came for him to say good-bye to norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had to do. it was a very dark, cloudy night, they were a bit late arriving at hagrid hut because they’d had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in entrance hall, where he’d been playing tennis against wall. hagrid had norbert packed ready in a large crate. got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer journey,” said hagrid in a muffled voice. i’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.” from inside crate came ripping noises that sounded to as though teddy was having his head torn off. norbert!” hagrid sobbed, as hermione covered crate with invisibility cloak stepped underneath it themselves. will never forget you!” how they managed to get crate back up to castle, they never knew. midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up marble staircase in entrance hall along dark corridors. up another staircase, then another even one of harry’s shortcuts didn’t make work much easier. there!” panted as they reached corridor beneath tallest tower. then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop crate. forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into shadows, staring at dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. a lamp flared. professor mcgonagall, in a tartan bathrobe a hair net, had malfoy by ear. she shouted. twenty points from slytherin! wandering around in middle of night, how dare you don’t understand, professor. potter’s coming he’s got a dragon!” utter rubbish! how dare you tell such lies! come on i shall see professor snape about you, malfoy!” steep spiral staircase up to top of tower seemed easiest thing in world after that. not until they’d stepped out into cold night air did they throw off cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. hermione did a sort of jig. got detention! i could sing!” advised her. chuckling about malfoy, they waited, norbert thrashing about in his crate. about ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of darkness. charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. they showed hermione harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend norbert between them. they all helped buckle norbert safely into it then hermione shook hands with others thanked them very much. at last, norbert was going ... going ... gone. they slipped back down spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that norbert was off them. no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness? answer to that was waiting at foot of stairs. as they stepped into corridor, filch’s face loomed suddenly out of darkness. well, well,” he whispered, are in trouble.” they’d left invisibility cloak on top of tower. forbidden forest things couldn’t have been worse. filch took them down to professor mcgonagall’s study on first floor, where they sat waited without saying a word to each other. hermione was trembling. excuses, alibis, wild cover-up stories chased each other around harry’s brain, each more feeble than last. he couldn’t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. they were cornered. how could they have been so stupid as to forget cloak? there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed creeping around school in dead of night, let alone being up tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. add norbert invisibility cloak, they might as well be packing their bags already. had thought that things couldn’t have been worse? he was wrong. when professor mcgonagall appeared, she was leading neville. neville burst out, moment he saw other two. was trying to find you to warn you, i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag shook his head violently to shut neville up, but professor mcgonagall had seen. she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over three of them. would never have believed it of any of you. mr. filch says you were up in astronomy tower. it’s one o’clock in morning. explain yourselves.” it was first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question. she was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. think i’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said professor mcgonagall. doesn’t take a genius to work it out. you fed draco malfoy some cock-and- bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed into trouble. i’ve already caught him. i suppose you think it’s funny that longbottom here heard story believed it, too?” caught neville’s eye tried to tell him without words that this wasn’t true, because neville was looking stunned hurt. poor, blundering neville knew what it must have cost him to try find them in dark, to warn them. disgusted,” said professor mcgonagall. students out of bed in one night! i’ve never heard of such a thing before! you, miss granger, i thought you had more sense. as for you, mr. potter, i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this. all three of you will receive detentions yes, you too, mr. longbottom, nothing gives you right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous fifty points will be taken from gryffindor.” gasped they would lose lead, lead he’d won in last quidditch match. points each,” said professor mcgonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. please can’t—” tell me what i can can’t do, potter. now get back to bed, all of you. i’ve never been more ashamed of gryffindor students.” a hundred fifty points lost. that put gryffindor in last place. in one night, they’d ruined any chance gryffindor had had for house cup. felt as though bottom had dropped out of his stomach. how could they ever make up for this? didn’t sleep all night. he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort him. he knew neville, like himself, was dreading dawn. what would happen when rest of gryffindor found out what they’d done? at first, gryffindors passing giant hourglasses that recorded house points next day thought there been a mistake. how could they suddenly have a hundred fifty points fewer than yesterday? then story started to spread: potter, famous potter, their hero of two quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him a couple of other stupid first years. from being one of most popular admired people at school, was suddenly most hated. even ravenclaws hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose house cup. everywhere went, people pointed didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. slytherins, on other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling cheering, potter, we owe you one!” only ron stood by him. all forget this in a few weeks. fred george have lost loads of points in all time they’ve been here, people still like them.” never lost a hundred fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said miserably. no,” ron admitted. it was a bit late to repair damage, but swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. he’d had it with sneaking around spying. he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood offered to resign from quidditch team. wood thundered. good’ll that do? how are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at quidditch?” but even quidditch had lost its fun. rest of team wouldn’t speak to during practice, if they had to speak about him, they called him seeker.” hermione neville were suffering, too. they didn’t have as bad a time as harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down working in silence. was almost glad that exams weren’t far away. all studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. he, ron, hermione kept to themselves, working late into night, trying to remember ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms spells by heart, memorize dates of magical discoveries goblin rebellions. ... then, about a week before exams were due to start, harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test. walking back from library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. as he drew closer, he heard quirrell’s voice. no not again, please it sounded as though someone was threatening him. moved closer. right all right he heard quirrell sob. next second, quirrell came hurrying out of classroom straightening his turban. he was pale looked as though he was about to cry. he strode out of sight; didn’t think quirrell had even noticed him. he waited until quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into classroom. it was empty, but a door stood ajar at other end. was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling. all same, he’d have gambled twelve sorcerer’s stones that snape had just left room, from what had just heard, snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last. went back to library, where hermione was testing ron on astronomy. told them what he’d heard. done it, then!” said ron. quirrell’s told him how to break his anti-dark force spell still fluffy, though,” said hermione. snape’s found out how to get past him without asking hagrid,” said ron, looking up at thousands of books surrounding them. bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. so what do we do, harry?” light of adventure was kindling again in ron’s eyes, but hermione answered before could. to dumbledore. that’s what we should have done ages ago. if we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.” we’ve got no proof.” said harry. too scared to back us up. snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how troll got in at halloween that he was nowhere near third floor who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? it’s not exactly a secret we hate him, dumbledore think we made it up to get him sacked. filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with snape, more students get thrown out, better, he’ll think. don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about or fluffy. that’ll take a lot of explaining.” hermione looked convinced, but ron didn’t. we just do a bit of poking around said flatly, done enough poking around.” he pulled a map of jupiter toward him started to learn names of its moons. following morning, notes were delivered to harry, hermione, neville at breakfast table. they were all same: your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight. meet mr. filch in entrance hall. professor m. mcgonagall had forgotten they still had detentions to do in furor over points they’d lost. he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. like harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got. at eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to ron in common room went down to entrance hall with neville. filch was already there so was malfoy. had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention, too. me,” said filch, lighting a lamp leading them outside. bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. yes . . . hard work pain are best teachers if you ask me. ... it’s just a pity they let old punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from ceiling for a few days, i’ve got chains still in my office, keep well oiled in case they’re ever needed. ... right, off we go, don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” they marched off across dark grounds. neville kept sniffing. wondered what their punishment was going to be. it must be something really horrible, or filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. ahead, could see lighted windows of hagrid’s hut. then they heard a distant shout. that you, filch? hurry up, i want ter get started.” harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. his relief must have showed in his face, because filch said, suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? well, think again, boy it’s into forest you’re going i’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” at this, neville let out a little moan, malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. forest?” he repeated, he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual. can’t go in there at night there’s all sorts of things in there werewolves, i heard.” neville clutched sleeve of harry’s robe made a choking noise. your problem, isn’t it?” said filch, his voice cracking with glee. thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?” hagrid came striding toward them out of dark, fang at his heel. he was carrying his large crossbow, a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. time,” he said. bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. all right, harry, hermione?” shouldn’t be too friendly to them, hagrid,” said filch coldly, here to be punished, after all.” why yer late, is it?” said hagrid, frowning at filch. lecturin’ them, eh? your place ter do that. yeh’ve done yer bit, i’ll take over from here.” be back at dawn,” said filch, what’s left of them,” he added nastily, he turned started back toward castle, his lamp bobbing away in darkness. malfoy now turned to hagrid. not going in that forest,” he said, was pleased to hear note of panic in his voice. are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts,” said hagrid fiercely. done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.” this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. i thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew i was doing this, he’d tell yer that’s how it is at hogwarts,” hagrid growled. lines! what good’s that ter anyone? yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. if yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter castle an’ pack. go on!” malfoy didn’t move. he looked at hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. then,” said hagrid, listen carefully, it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ i don’ want no one takin’ risks. follow me over here a moment.” he led them to very edge of forest. holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into thick black trees. a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into forest. there,” said hagrid, that stuff shinin’ on ground? silvery stuff? that’s unicorn blood. there’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. this is second time in a week. i found one dead last wednesday. we’re gonna try an’ find poor thing. we might have ter put it out of its misery.” what if whatever hurt unicorn finds us first?” said malfoy, unable to keep fear out of his voice. nothin’ that lives in forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang,” said hagrid. keep ter path. right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow trail in diff’rent directions. there’s blood all over place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.” want fang,” said malfoy quickly, looking at fang’s long teeth. right, but i warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said hagrid. me, harry, an’ hermione’ll go one way an’ draco, neville, an’ fang’ll go other. now, if any of us finds unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? get yer wands out an’ practice now that’s it an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh so, be careful let’s go.” forest was black silent. a little way into it they reached a fork in earth path, harry, hermione, hagrid took left path while malfoy, neville, fang took right. they walked in silence, their eyes on ground. every now then a ray of moonlight through branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on fallen leaves. saw that hagrid looked very worried. could a werewolf be killing unicorns?” asked. fast enough,” said hagrid. not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. i never knew one ter be hurt before.” they walked past a mossy tree stump. could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. there were still spots of unicorn blood here there along winding path. all right, hermione?” hagrid whispered. worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then well be able ter get behind that tree!” hagrid seized hermione hoisted them off path behind a towering oak. he pulled out an arrow fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. three of them listened. something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along ground. hagrid was squinting up dark path, but after a few seconds, sound faded away. knew it,” he murmured. summat in here that shouldn’ be.” werewolf?” suggested. wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said hagrid grimly. follow me, but careful, now.” they walked more slowly, ears straining for faintest sound. suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. there?” hagrid called. yerself i’m armed!” into clearing came was it a man, or a horse? to waist, a man, with red hair beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. hermione’s jaws dropped. it’s you, ronan,” said hagrid in relief. are yeh?” he walked forward shook centaur’s hand. evening to you, hagrid,” said ronan. he had a deep, sorrowful voice. you going to shoot me?” be too careful, ronan,” said hagrid, patting his crossbow. summat bad loose in this forest. this is an’ hermione granger, by way. students up at school. an’ this is ronan, you two. he’s a centaur.” noticed,” said hermione faintly. evening,” said ronan. are you? do you learn much, up at school?” bit,” said hermione timidly. bit. well, that’s something.” ronan sighed. he flung back his head stared at sky. is bright tonight.” said hagrid, glancing up, too. i’m glad we’ve run inter yeh, ronan, there’s a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin’?” ronan didn’t answer immediately. he stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. innocent are first victims,” he said. it has been for ages past, so it is now.” said hagrid, have yeh seen anythin’, ronan? anythin’ unusual?” is bright tonight,” ronan repeated, while hagrid watched him impatiently. bright.” but i was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” said hagrid. yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?” yet again, ronan took a while to answer. at last, he said, forest hides many secrets.” a movement in trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired wilder-looking than ronan. bane,” said hagrid. right?” evening, hagrid, i hope you are well?” enough. look, i’ve jus’ bin askin’ ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in here lately? there’s a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin’ about it?” bane walked over to stand next to ronan. he looked skyward. is bright tonight,” he said simply. heard,” said hagrid grumpily. if either of you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? we’ll be off, then.” hermione followed him out of clearing, staring over their shoulders at ronan bane until trees blocked their view. said hagrid irritably, an’ get a straight answer out of a centaur. ruddy stargazers. not interested in anythin’ closer’n moon.” there many of them in here?” asked hermione. a fair few. . . . keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever i want a word. they’re deep, mind, centaurs ... they know things ... jus’ don’ let on much.” think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said harry. that sound like hooves to you? nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s bin killin’ unicorns never heard anythin’ like it before.” they walked on through dense, dark trees. kept looking nervously over his shoulder. he had nasty feeling they were being watched. he was very glad they had hagrid his crossbow with them. they had just passed a bend in path when hermione grabbed hagrid arm. look! red sparks, others are in trouble!” two wait here!” hagrid shouted. on path, i’ll come back for yeh!” they heard him crashing away through undergrowth stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but rustling of leaves around them. don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered hermione. don’t care if malfoy has, but if something’s got neville ... it’s our fault he’s here in first place.” minutes dragged by. their ears seemed sharper than usual. harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of wind, every cracking twig. what was going on? where were others? at last, a great crunching noise announced hagrid’s return. malfoy, neville, fang were with him. hagrid was fuming. malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind neville grabbed him as a joke. neville had panicked sent up sparks. be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with racket you two were makin’. right, we’re changin’ groups neville, you stay with me an’ hermione, harry, you go with fang an’ this idiot. i’m sorry,” hagrid added in a whisper to harry, he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” so set off into heart of forest with malfoy fang. they walked for nearly half an hour, deeper deeper into forest, until path became almost impossible to follow because trees were so thick. thought blood seemed to be getting thicker. there were splashes on roots of a tree, as though poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. could see a clearing ahead, through tangled branches of an ancient oak. he murmured, holding out his arm to stop malfoy. something bright white was gleaming on ground. they inched closer. it was unicorn all right, it was dead. had never seen anything so beautiful sad. its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen its mane was spread pearly-white on dark leaves. had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. a bush on edge of clearing quivered. ... then, out of shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across ground like some stalking beast. harry, malfoy, fang stood transfixed. cloaked figure reached unicorn, lowered its head over wound in animals side, began to drink its blood. ! malfoy let out a terrible scream bolted so did fang. hooded figure raised its head looked right at unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. it got to its feet came swiftly toward he couldn’t move for fear. then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. half blinded, he staggered backward. he heard hooves behind him, galloping, something jumped clean over harry, charging at figure. pain in harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. it took a minute or two to pass. when he looked up, figure had gone. a centaur was standing over him, not ronan or bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair a palomino body. you all right?” said centaur, pulling to his feet. thank you what was that?” centaur didn’t answer. he had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. he looked carefully at harry, his eyes lingering on scar that stood out, livid, on harry’s forehead. are boy,” he said. had better get back to hagrid. forest is not safe at this time especially for you. can you ride? it will be quicker this way. name is firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that could clamber onto his back. there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from other side of clearing. ronan bane came bursting through trees, their flanks heaving sweaty. bane thundered. are you doing? you have a human on your back! have you no shame? are you a common mule?” you realize who this is?” said firenze. is boy. quicker he leaves this forest, better.” have you been telling him?” growled bane. firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against heavens. have we not read what is to come in movements of planets?” ronan pawed ground nervously. sure firenze thought he was acting for best,” he said in his gloomy voice. bane kicked his back legs in anger. best! what is that to do with us? centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!” firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that had to grab his shoulders to stay on. you not see that unicorn?” firenze bellowed at bane. you not understand why it was killed? or have planets not let you in on that secret? i set myself against what is lurking in this forest, bane, yes, with humans alongside me if i must.” firenze whisked around; with clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into trees, leaving ronan bane behind them. didn’t have a clue what was going on. bane so angry?” he asked. was that thing you saved me from, anyway?” firenze slowed to a walk, warned to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer harry’s question. they made their way through trees in silence for so long that thought firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when firenze suddenly stopped. potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” said harry, startled by odd question. only used horn tail hair in potions.” is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said firenze. one who has nothing to lose, everything to gain, would commit such a crime. blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. you have slain something pure defenseless to save yourself, you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from moment blood touches your lips.” stared at back of firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in moonlight. who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?” is,” firenze agreed, all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength power something that will mean you can never die. mr. potter, do you know what is hidden in school at this very moment?” sorcerer’s stone! of course elixir of life! but i don’t understand who you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?” it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry’s heart. over rustling of trees, he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on night they had met: say he died. codswallop, in my opinion. dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.” you mean,” croaked, was voz harry, are you all right?” hermione was running toward them down path, hagrid puffing along behind her. fine,” said harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. unicorn’s dead, hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.” is where i leave you,” firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine unicorn. are safe now.” slid off his back. luck, potter,” said firenze. planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. i hope this is one of those times.” he turned cantered back into depths of forest, leaving shivering behind him. ron had fallen asleep in dark common room, waiting for them to return. he shouted something about quidditch fouls when roughly shook him awake. in a matter of seconds, though, he was wide- eyed as began to tell him hermione what had happened in forest. couldn’t sit down. he paced up down in front of fire. he was still shaking. wants for voldemort ... voldemort’s waiting in forest ... all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich. ...” saying name!” said ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought voldemort could hear them. wasn’t listening. saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. ... bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering with what planets say is going to happen. ... they must show that voldemort’s coming back. ... bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me. ... i suppose that’s written in stars as well.” you stop saying name\\” ron hissed. all i’ve got to wait for now is snape to steal stone,” went on feverishly, voldemort will be able to come finish me off. ... well, i suppose bane be happy.” hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. everyone says dumbledore’s only one you-know-who was ever afraid of. with dumbledore around, you-know-who won’t touch you. anyway, who says centaurs are right? it sounds like fortune-telling to me, professor mcgonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” sky had turned light before they stopped talking. they went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. but night’s surprises weren’t over. when pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. there was a note pinned to it: just in case. through trapdoor in years to come, would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through door at any moment. yet days crept by, there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive well behind locked door. it was sweltering hot, especially in large classroom where they did their written papers. they had been given special, new quills for exams, which had been bewitched with an anti-cheating spell. they had practical exams as well. professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion. did best he could, trying to ignore stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into forest. neville thought had a bad case of exam nerves because couldn’t sleep, but truth was that kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what had seen in forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but ron hermione didn’t seem as worried about as harry. idea of voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to. their very last exam was history of magic. one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented self-stirring cauldrons they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. when ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills roll up their parchment, couldn’t help cheering with rest. was far easier than i thought it would be,” said hermione as they joined crowds flocking out onto sunny grounds. needn’t have learned about werewolf code of conduct or uprising of elfric eager.” hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to lake flopped under a tree. weasley twins lee jordan were tickling tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in warm shallows. more studying,” ron sighed happily, stretching out on grass. could look more cheerful, harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.” was rubbing his forehead. wish i knew what this means\\” he burst out angrily. scar keeps hurting it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” to madam pomfrey,” hermione suggested. not ill,” said harry. think it’s a warning ... it means danger’s coming. ...” ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. relax, hermione right, stone’s safe as long as dumbledore’s around. anyway, we’ve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy. he nearly had his leg ripped off once, he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down.” nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. when he tried to explain this, hermione said, just exams. i woke up last night was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we’d done that one.” was quite sure unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work, though. he watched an owl flutter toward school across bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. hagrid was only one who ever sent him letters. hagrid would never betray dumbledore. hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy . . . never . . . but suddenly jumped to his feet. you going?” said ron sleepily. just thought of something,” said harry. he had turned white. got to go see hagrid, now.” panted hermione, hurrying to keep up. you think it’s a bit odd,” said harry, scrambling up grassy slope, what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? how many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? lucky they found hagrid, don’t you think? why didn’t i see it before?” are you talking about?” said ron, but harry, sprinting across grounds toward forest, didn’t answer. hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers sleeves were rolled up, he was shelling peas into a large bowl. he said, smiling. yer exams? got time fer a drink?” please,” said ron, but cut him off. we’re in a hurry. hagrid, i’ve got to ask you something. you know that night you won norbert? what did stranger you were playing cards with look like?” said hagrid casually, wouldn’ take his cloak off.” he saw three of them look stunned raised his eyebrows. not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in hog’s head that’s one o’ pubs down in village. mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? i never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” sank down next to bowl of peas. did you talk to him about, hagrid? did you mention hogwarts at all?” come up,” said hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. ... he asked what i did, an’ i told him i was gamekeeper here. ... he asked a bit about sorta creatures i look after ... so i told him ... an’ i said what i’d always really wanted was a dragon ... an’ then ... i can’ remember too well, he kept buyin’ me drinks. ... let’s see ... yeah, then he said he had dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if i wanted . . . but he had ter be sure i could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. ... so i told him, after fluffy, a dragon would be easy. ...” did he did he seem interested in fluffy?” asked, trying to keep his voice calm. yeah how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around hogwarts? so i told him, fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified. shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. i said it! hey where’re yeh goin’?” harry, ron, hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in entrance hall, which seemed very cold gloomy after grounds. got to go to dumbledore,” said harry. told that stranger how to get past fluffy, it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must’ve been easy, once he’d got hagrid drunk. i just hope dumbledore believes us. firenze might back us up if bane doesn’t stop him. where’s dumbledore’s office?” they looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in right direction. they had never been told where dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. just have to began, but a voice suddenly rang across hall. are you three doing inside?” it was professor mcgonagall, carrying a large pile of books. want to see professor dumbledore,” said hermione, rather bravely, ron thought. professor dumbledore?” professor mcgonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. swallowed now what? sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because professor mcgonagall’s nostrils flared. dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. received an urgent owl from ministry of magic flew off for london at once.” gone?” said frantically. dumbledore is a very great wizard, potter, he has many demands on his time this is important.” you have to say is more important than ministry of magic, potter?” said harry, throwing caution to winds, it’s about sorcerer’s whatever professor mcgonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up. do you know ?” she spluttered. i think i know that sn that someone’s going to try steal stone. i’ve got to talk to professor dumbledore.” she eyed him with a mixture of shock suspicion. dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. don’t know how you found out about stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” professor i know what i’m talking about,” she said shortly. she bent down gathered up fallen books. suggest you all go back outside enjoy sunshine.” but they didn’t. tonight,” said harry, once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot. going through trapdoor tonight. he’s found out everything he needs, now he’s got dumbledore out of way. he sent that note, i bet ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up.” what can we hermione gasped. ron wheeled round. snape was standing there. afternoon,” he said smoothly. they stared at him. shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile. were began, without any idea what he was going to say. want to be more careful,” said snape. around like this, people will think you’re up to something. gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” flushed. they turned to go outside, but snape called them back. warned, any more nighttime wanderings i will personally make sure you are expelled. good day to you.” he strode off in direction of staffroom. out on steps, turned to others. here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside staffroom follow him if he leaves it. hermione, you’d better do that.” me?” obvious,” said ron. can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick, you know.” he put on a high voice, professor flitwick, i’m so worried, i think i got question fourteen b wrong. . . . shut up,” said hermione, but she agreed to go watch out for snape. we’d better stay outside third-floor corridor,” told ron. on.” but that part of plan didn’t work. no sooner had they reached door separating fluffy from rest of school than professor mcgonagall turned up again this time, she lost her temper. suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. of this nonsense! if i hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, i’ll take another fifty points from gryffindor! yes, weasley, from my own house!” ron went back to common room. had just said, least hermione’s on snape’s tail,” when portrait of fat lady swung open hermione came in. sorry, harry!” she wailed. came out asked me what i was doing, so i said i was waiting for flitwick, snape went to get him, i’ve only just got away, i don’t know where snape went.” that’s it then, isn’t it?” said. other two stared at him. he was pale his eyes were glittering. going out of here tonight i’m going to try get to first.” mad!” said ron. can’t!” said hermione. what mcgonagall snape have said? you’ll be expelled!” what?” shouted. you understand? if snape gets hold of stone, voldemort’s coming back! haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? there won’t be any hogwarts to get expelled from! he’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for dark arts! losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? d’you think he’ll leave you your families alone if gryffindor wins house cup? if i get caught before i can get to stone, well, i’ll have to go back to dursleys wait for voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than i would have, because i’m never going over to dark side! i’m going through that trapdoor tonight nothing you two say is going to stop me! voldemort killed my parents, remember?” he glared at them. right, harry,” said hermione in a small voice. use invisibility cloak,” said harry. just lucky i got it back.” will it cover all three of us?” said ron. all three of us?” come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” course not,” said hermione briskly. do you think you’d get to without us? i’d better go look through my books, there might be something useful. ...” if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” if i can help it,” said hermione grimly. told me in secret that i got a hundred twelve percent on his exam. they’re not throwing me out after that.” after dinner three of them sat nervously apart in common room. nobody bothered them; none of gryffindors had anything to say to any more, after all. this was first night he hadn’t been upset by it. hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of enchantments they were about to try to break. ron didn’t talk much. both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. slowly, room emptied as people drifted off to bed. get cloak,” ron muttered, as lee jordan finally left, stretching yawning. ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. he pulled out cloak then his eyes fell on flute hagrid had given him for christmas. he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didn’t feel much like singing. he ran back down to common room. better put cloak on here, make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own are you doing?” said a voice from corner of room. neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching trevor toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. neville, nothing,” said harry, hurriedly putting cloak behind his back. neville stared at their guilty faces. going out again,” he said. no, no,” said hermione. we’re not. why don’t you go to bed, neville?” looked at grandfather clock by door. they couldn’t afford to waste any more time, snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep. can’t go out,” said neville, be caught again. gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” don’t understand,” said harry, is important.” but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of portrait hole. i’ll fight you!” ron exploded, away from that hole don’t be an idiot you call me an idiot!” said neville. don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! you were one who told me to stand up to people!” but not to us,” said ron in exasperation. you don’t know what you’re doing.” he took a step forward neville dropped trevor toad, who leapt out of sight. on then, try hit me!” said neville, raising his fists. ready!” turned to hermione. something,” he said desperately. hermione stepped forward. she said, really, really sorry about this.” she raised her wand. totalusl” she cried, pointing it at neville. neville’s arms snapped to his sides. his legs sprang together. his whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. hermione ran to turn him over. neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. you done to him?” whispered. full body-bind,” said hermione miserably. neville, i’m so sorry.” had to, neville, no time to explain,” said harry. understand later, neville,” said ron as they stepped over him pulled on invisibility cloak. but leaving neville lying motionless on floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. in their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them. at foot of first set of stairs, they spotted mrs. norris skulking near top. let’s kick her, just this once,” ron whispered in harry’s ear, but shook his head. as they climbed carefully around her, mrs. norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. they didn’t meet anyone else until they reached staircase up to third floor. peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening carpet so that people would trip. there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. he narrowed his wicked black eyes. you’re there, even if i can’t see you. are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” he rose up in air floated there, squinting at them. call filch, i should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.” had a sudden idea. he said, in a hoarse whisper, bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible.” peeves almost fell out of air in shock. he caught himself in time hovered about a foot off stairs. sorry, your bloodiness, mr. baron, sir,” he said greasily. mistake, my mistake i didn’t see you of course i didn’t, you’re invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke, sir.” have business here, peeves,” croaked harry. away from this place tonight.” will, sir, i most certainly will,” said peeves, rising up in air again. your business goes well, baron, i’ll not bother you.” he scooted off. harry!” whispered ron. a few seconds later, they were there, outside third-floor corridor door was already ajar. there you are,” said quietly, already got past fluffy.” seeing open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. underneath cloak, turned to other two. you want to go back, i won’t blame you,” he said. can take cloak, i won’t need it now.” be stupid,” said ron. coming,” said hermione. pushed door open. as door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. all three of dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them. that at its feet?” hermione whispered. like a harp,” said ron. must have left it there.” must wake up moment you stop playing,” said harry. here goes ...” he put hagrid’s flute to his lips blew. it wasn’t really a tune, but from first note beast’s eyes began to droop. hardly drew breath. slowly, dog’s growls ceased it tottered on its paws fell to its knees, then it slumped to ground, fast asleep. playing,” ron warned as they slipped out of cloak crept toward trapdoor. they could feel dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached giant heads. think we’ll be able to pull door open,” said ron, peering over dog’s back. to go first, hermione?” i don’t!” right.” ron gritted his teeth stepped carefully over dog’s legs. he bent pulled ring of trapdoor, which swung up open. can you see?” hermione said anxiously. just black there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.” harry, who was still playing flute, waved at ron to get his attention pointed at himself. want to go first? are you sure?” said ron. don’t know how deep this thing goes. give flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep.” handed flute over. in few seconds’ silence, dog growled twitched, but moment hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. climbed over it looked down through trapdoor. there was no sign of bottom. he lowered himself through hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. then he looked up at ron said, anything happens to me, don’t follow. go straight to owlery send hedwig to dumbledore, right?” said ron. you in a minute, i hope. ...” let go. cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down flump. with a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. he sat up felt around, his eyes not used to gloom. it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. okay!” he called up to light size of a postage stamp, which was open trapdoor, a soft landing, you can jump!” ron followed right away. he landed, sprawled next to harry. this stuff?” were his first words. some sort of plant thing. i suppose it’s here to break fall. come on, hermione!” distant music stopped. there was a loud bark from dog, but hermione had already jumped. she landed on harry’s other side. must be miles under school,” she said. this plant thing’s here, really,” said ron. shrieked hermione. at you both!” she leapt up struggled toward a damp wall. she had to struggle because moment she had landed, plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. as for ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. hermione had managed to free herself before plant got a firm grip on her. now she watched in horror as two boys fought to pull plant off them, but more they strained against it, tighter faster plant wound around them. moving!” hermione ordered them. know what this is it’s devil’s snare!” i’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled ron, leaning back, trying to stop plant from curling around his neck. up, i’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said hermione. hurry up, i can’t breathe!” gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. snare, devil’s snare ... what did professor sprout say? it likes dark damp light a fire!” choked. of course but there’s no wood!” hermione cried, wringing her hands. you gone mad?” ron bellowed. you a witch or not?” right!” said hermione, she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, sent a jet of same bluebell flames she had used on snape at plant. in a matter of seconds, two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from light warmth. wriggling flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, they were able to pull free. you pay attention in herbology, hermione,” said as he joined her by wall, wiping sweat off his face. said ron, lucky doesn’t lose his head in a crisis no wood,’ honestly.” way,” said harry, pointing down a passageway, which was only way forward. all they could hear apart from their footsteps was gentle drip of water trickling down walls. passageway sloped downward, was reminded of gringotts. with an unpleasant jolt of heart, he remembered dragons said to be guarding vaults in wizards’ bank. if they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon norbert had been bad enough ... you hear something?” ron whispered. listened. a soft rustling clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. you think it’s a ghost?” don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.” light ahead i can see something moving.” they reached end of passageway saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. it was full of small, jewel- bright birds, fluttering tumbling all around room. on opposite side of chamber was a heavy wooden door. you think they’ll attack us if we cross room?” said ron. said harry. don’t look very vicious, but i suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there’s no other choice ... i’ll run.” he took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, sprinted across room. he expected to feel sharp beaks claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. he reached door untouched. he pulled handle, but it was locked. other two followed him. they tugged heaved at door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm. what?” said ron. birds ... they can’t be here just for decoration,” said hermione. they watched birds soaring overhead, glittering glittering? not birds!” said suddenly. keys\\ winged keys look carefully. so that must mean ...” he looked around chamber while other two squinted up at flock of keys. \"... yes look! broomsticks! we’ve got to catch key to door!” there are hundreds of them!” ron examined lock on door. looking for a big, old-fashioned one probably silver, like handle.” they each seized a broomstick kicked off into air, soaring into midst of cloud of keys. they grabbed snatched, but bewitched keys darted dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. not for nothing, though, was youngest seeker in a century. he had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. after a minute’s weaving about through whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught stuffed roughly into keyhole. one!” he called to others. big one there no, there with bright blue wings feathers are all crumpled on one side.” ron went speeding in direction that was pointing, crashed into ceiling, nearly fell off his broom. got to close in on it!” called, not taking his eyes off key with damaged wing. you come at it from above hermione, stay below stop it from going down i’ll try catch it. right, now!” ron dived, hermione rocketed upward, key dodged them both, streaked after it; it sped toward wall, leaned forward with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against with one hand. ron hermione cheers echoed around high chamber. they landed quickly, ran to door, key struggling in his hand. he rammed it into lock turned it worked. moment lock had clicked open, key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. asked other two, his hand on door handle. they nodded. he pulled door open. next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. but as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded room to reveal an astonishing sight. they were standing on edge of a huge chessboard, behind black chessmen, which were all taller than they were carved from what looked like black stone. facing them, way across chamber, were white pieces. harry, ron hermione shivered slightly towering white chessmen had no faces. what do we do?” whispered. obvious, isn’t it?” said ron. got to play our way across room.” behind white pieces they could see another door. said hermione nervously. think,” said ron, going to have to be chessmen.” he walked up to a black knight put his hand out to touch knights horse. at once, sprang to life. horse pawed ground knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron. we er have to join you to get across?” black knight nodded. ron turned to other two. needs thinking about. ...” he said. suppose we’ve got to take place of three of black pieces. hermione stayed quiet, watching ron think. finally he said, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess not offended,” said quickly. tell us what to do.” harry, you take place of that bishop, hermione, you go there instead of that castle.” about you?” going to be a knight,” said ron. chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, a castle turned their backs on white pieces walked off board, leaving three empty squares that harry, ron, hermione took. always plays first in chess,” said ron, peering across board. ... look ...” a white pawn had moved forward two squares. ron started to direct black pieces. they moved silently wherever he sent them. harry’s knees were trembling. what if they lost? move diagonally four squares to right.” their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. white queen smashed him to floor dragged him off board, where he lay quite still, facedown. to let that happen,” said ron, looking shaken. you free to take that bishop, hermione, go on.” every time one of their men was lost, white pieces showed no mercy. soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along wall. twice, ron only just noticed in time that hermione were in danger. he himself darted around board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. me think let me think ...” white queen turned her blank face toward him. ...” said ron softly, only way ... i’ve got to be taken.” hermione shouted. chess!” snapped ron. got to make some sacrifices! i make my move she’ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate king, harry!” you want to stop snape or not?” if you don’t hurry up, hell already have stone!” there was no alternative. ron called, his face pale but determined. i go now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” he stepped forward, white queen pounced. she struck ron hard across head with her arm, he crashed to floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square white queen dragged ron to one side. he looked as if he’d been knocked out. shaking, moved three spaces to left. white king took off his crown threw it at harry’s feet. they had won. chessmen parted bowed, leaving door ahead clear. with one last desperate look back at ron, hermione charged through door up next passageway. if he’s ?” be all right,” said harry, trying to convince himself. do you reckon’s next?” had sprout’s, that was devil’s snare; flitwick must’ve put charms on keys; mcgonagall transfigured chessmen to make them alive; that leaves quirrell’s spell, snape’s ...” they had reached another door. right?” whispered. on.” pushed it open. a disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. eyes watering, they saw, flat on floor in front of them, a troll even larger than one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. on, i can’t breathe.” he pulled open next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. said harry. do we have to do?” they stepped over threshold, immediately a fire sprang up behind them in doorway. it wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. at same instant, black flames shot up in doorway leading onward. they were trapped. hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to bottles. looked over her shoulder to read it: danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, two of us will help you, whichever you would find, one among us seven will let you move ahead, another will transport drinker back instead, two among our number hold only nettle wine, three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, to help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: first, however slyly poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; second, different are those who stand at either end, but if you would move onward, neither is your friend; third, as you see clearly, all are different size, neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; fourth, second left second on right are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, very last thing he felt like doing. said hermione. isn’t magic it’s logic a puzzle. a lot of greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.” so will we, won’t we?” course not,” said hermione. we need is here on this paper. seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through black fire, one will get us back through purple.” how do we know which to drink?” me a minute.” hermione read paper several times. then she walked up down line of bottles, muttering to herself pointing at them. at last, she clapped her hands. it,” she said. smallest bottle will get us through black fire toward stone.” looked at tiny bottle. only enough there for one of us,” he said. hardly one swallow.” they looked at each other. one will get you back through purple flames?” hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at right end of line. drink that,” said harry. listen, get back get ron. grab brooms from flying-key room, they’ll get you out of trapdoor past fluffy go straight to owlery send hedwig to dumbledore, we need him. i might be able to hold snape off for a while, but i’m no match for him, really.” what if you-know- who’s with him?” i was lucky once, wasn’t i?” said harry, pointing at his scar. might get lucky again.” hermione’s lip trembled, she suddenly dashed at threw her arms around him. you’re a great wizard, you know.” not as good as you,” said harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. said hermione. cleverness! there are more important things friendship bravery oh be carefull” drink first,” said harry. are sure which is which, aren’t you?” said hermione. she took a long drink from round bottle at end, shuddered. not poison?” said anxiously. but it’s like ice.” go, before it wears off.” luck take care hermione turned walked straight through purple fire. took a deep breath picked up smallest bottle. he turned to face black flames. i come,” he said, he drained little bottle in one gulp. it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. he put bottle down walked forward; he braced himself, saw black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on other side, in last chamber. there was already someone there but it wasn’t snape. it wasn’t even voldemort. man with two faces it was quirrell. gasped harry. quirrell smiled. his face wasn’t twitching at all. he said calmly. wondered whether i’d be meeting you here, potter.” i thought snape quirrell laughed, it wasn’t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold sharp. severus does seem type, doesn’t he? so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- stuttering p-professor quirrell?” couldn’t take it in. this couldn’t be true, it couldn’t. snape tried to kill me!” no, no. tried to kill you. your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match. she broke my eye contact with you. another few seconds i’d have got you off that broom. i’d have managed it before then if snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” was trying to save me?” course,” said quirrell coolly. do you think he wanted to referee your next match? he was trying to make sure i didn’t do it again. funny, really ... he needn’t have bothered. i couldn’t do anything with dumbledore watching. all other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular . . . what a waste of time, when after all that, i’m going to kill you tonight.” quirrell snapped his fingers. ropes sprang out of thin air wrapped themselves tightly around harry. too nosy to live, potter. scurrying around school on halloween like that, for all i knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding stone.” you let troll in?” i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to one in chamber back there? unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, snape, who already suspected me, went straight to third floor to head me off not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite snape leg off properly. wait quietly, potter. i need to examine this interesting mirror.” it was only then that realized what was standing behind quirrell. it was mirror of erised. mirror is key to finding stone,” quirrell murmured, tapping his way around frame. dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . but he’s in london ... i’ll be far away by time he gets back. ...” all could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking stop him from concentrating on mirror. saw you snape in forest he blurted out. said quirrell idly, walking around mirror to look at back. was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far i’d got. he suspected me all along. tried to frighten me as though he could, when i had lord voldemort on my side. ...” quirrell came back out from behind mirror stared hungrily into it. see ... i’m presenting it to my master ... but where is it?” struggled against ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to mirror. snape always seemed to hate me so much.” he does,” said quirrell casually, yes. he was at hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? they loathed each other. but he never wanted you dead.” i heard you a few days ago, sobbing i thought snape was threatening you. for first time, a spasm of fear flitted across quirrell’s face. he said, find it hard to follow my master’s instructions he is a great wizard i am weak mean he was there in classroom with you?” gasped. is with me wherever i go,” said quirrell quietly. met him when i traveled around world. a foolish young man i was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good evil. lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was. there is no good evil, there is only power, those too weak to seek it. ... since then, i have served him faithfully, although i have let him down many times. he has had to be very hard on me.” quirrell shivered suddenly. does not forgive mistakes easily. when i failed to steal from gringotts, he was most displeased. he punished me . . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me. ...” quirrell’s voice trailed away. was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid? he’d seen quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in leaky cauldron. quirrell cursed under his breath. don’t understand ... is inside mirror? should i break it?” harry’s mind was racing. what i want more than anything else in world at moment, he thought, is to find before quirrell does. so if i look in mirror, i should see my self finding it which means i’ll see where it’s hidden! but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i’m up to? he tried to edge to left, to get in front of glass without quirrell noticing, but ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped fell over. quirrell ignored him. he was still talking to himself. does this mirror do? how does it work? help me, master!” to harry’s horror, a voice answered, voice seemed to come from quirrell himself. boy ... use boy ...” quirrell rounded on harry. come here.” he clapped his hands once, ropes binding fell off. got slowly to his feet. here,” quirrell repeated. in mirror tell me what you see.” walked toward him. i must lie, he thought desperately. i must look lie about what i see, that’s all. quirrell moved close behind him. breathed in funny smell that seemed to come from quirrell’s turban. he closed his eyes, stepped in front of mirror, opened them again. he saw his reflection, pale scared-looking at first. but a moment later, reflection smiled at him. it put its hand into its pocket pulled out a blood- red stone. it winked put back in its pocket as it did so, felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. somehow incredibly he’d gotten stone. said quirrell impatiently. do you see?” screwed up his courage. see myself shaking hands with dumbledore,” he invented. i’ve won house cup for gryffindor.” quirrell cursed again. out of way,” he said. as moved aside, he felt sorcerer’s against his leg. dare he make a break for it? but he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. lies ... he lies ...” come back here!” quirrell shouted. me truth! what did you just see?” high voice spoke again. me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...” you are not strong enough!” have strength enough ... for this. ...” felt as if devil’s snare was rooting him to spot. he couldn’t move a muscle. petrified, he watched as quirrell reached up began to unwrap his turban. what was going on? turban fell away. quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. then he turned slowly on spot. would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. where there should have been a back to quirrell’s head, there was a face, most terrible face had ever seen. it was chalk white with glaring red eyes slits for nostrils, like a snake. ...” it whispered. tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move. what i have become?” face said. shadow vapor ... i have form only when i can share another’s body . . . but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts minds. ... unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks . . . you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in forest ... once i have elixir of life, i will be able to create a body of my own. ... now ... why don’t you give me that in your pocket?” so he knew. feeling suddenly surged back into harry’s legs. he stumbled backward. be a fool,” snarled face. save your own life join me ... or you’ll meet same end as your parents. ... they died begging me for mercy. ...” shouted suddenly. quirrell was walking backward at him, so that voldemort could still see him. evil face was now smiling. touching ...” it hissed. always value bravery. ... yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... i killed your father first, he put up a courageous fight . . . but your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to protect you. ... now give me stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.” sprang toward flame door, but voldemort screamed him!” next second, felt quirrell’s hand close on his wrist. at once, a needle-sharp pain seared across harry’s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, to his surprise, quirrell let go of him. pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone, saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes. him! seize him!” shrieked voldemort again, quirrell lunged, knocking clean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around harry’s neck harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see quirrell howling in agony. i cannot hold him my hands my hands!” quirrell, though pinning to ground with his knees, let go of his neck stared, bewildered, at his own palms could see they looked burned, raw, red, shiny. kill him, fool, be done!” screeched voldemort. quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but harry, by instinct, reached up grabbed quirrell’s face quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, then knew: quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. jumped to his feet, caught quirrell by arm, hung on as tight as he could. quirrell screamed tried to throw off pain in harry’s head was building he couldn’t see he could only hear quirrell’s terrible shrieks voldemort’s yells of, him! kill him!” other voices, maybe in harry’s own head, crying, harry!” he felt quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, fell into blackness, down ... down ... down ... something gold was glinting just above him. snitch! he tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. he blinked. it wasn’t snitch at all. it was a pair of glasses. how strange. he blinked again. smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him. afternoon, harry,” said dumbledore. stared at him. then he remembered: stone! it was quirrell! he’s got stone! sir, quick yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind times,” said dumbledore. does not have stone.” who does? sir, i please relax, or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out.” swallowed looked around him. he realized he must be in hospital wing. he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half candy shop. from your friends admirers,” said dumbledore, beaming. happened down in dungeons between you professor quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, whole school knows. i believe your friends misters fred george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. no doubt they thought it would amuse you. madam pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, confiscated it.” long have i been in here?” days. mr. ronald weasley miss granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.” sir, see you are not to be distracted. very well, stone. professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you. i arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, i must say.” got there? you got hermione’s owl?” must have crossed in midair. no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that place i should be was one i had just left. i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you was you.” feared i might be too late.” nearly were, i couldn’t have kept him off much longer stone, boy, you effort involved nearly killed you. for one terrible moment there, i was afraid it had. as for stone, it has been destroyed.” said blankly. your friend nicolas flamel you know about nicolas?” said dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. did do thing properly, didn’t you? well, nicolas i have had a little chat, agreed it’s all for best.” that means he his wife will die, won’t they?” have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order then, yes, they will die.” dumbledore smiled at look of amazement on harry’s face. one as young as you, i’m sure it seems incredible, but to nicolas perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. after all, to well- organized mind, death is but next great adventure. you know, was really not such a wonderful thing. as much money life as you could want! two things most human beings would choose above all trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.” lay there, lost for words. dumbledore hummed a little smiled at ceiling. said harry. been thinking ... sir even if stone’s gone, vol-, i mean, you-know-who him voldemort, harry. always use proper name for things. fear of a name increases fear of thing itself.” sir. well, voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back, isn’t he? i mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?” harry, he has not. he is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share ... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. he left quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. nevertheless, harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time if he is delayed again, again, why, he may never return to power.” nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. then he said, there are some other things i’d like to know, if you can tell me ... things i want to know truth about. ...” truth.” dumbledore sighed. is a beautiful terrible thing, should therefore be treated with great caution. however, i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to, in which case i beg you forgive me. i shall not, of course, lie.” ... voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. but why would he want to kill me in first place?” dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. first thing you ask me, i cannot tell you. not today. not now. you will know, one day ... put it from your mind for now, harry. when you are older . . . i know you hate to hear this . . . when you are ready, you will know.” knew it would be no good to argue. why couldn’t quirrell touch me?” mother died to save you. if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand, it is love. he didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. not a scar, no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply, even though person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. it is in your very skin. quirrell, full of hatred, greed, ambition, sharing his soul with voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.” dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on windowsill, which gave time to dry his eyes on sheet. when he had found his voice again, said, invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me?” your father happened to leave it in my possession, i thought you might like it.” dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. things ... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to kitchens to steal food when he was here.” there’s something else ...” away.” said snape snape, harry.” him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. is that true?” they did rather detest each other. not unlike yourself mr. malfoy. then, your father did something snape could never forgive.” saved his life.” ...” said dumbledore dreamily. way people’s minds work, isn’t it? professor snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him your father even. then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace. ...” tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. sir, there’s one more thing ...” one?” did i get out of mirror?” now, i’m glad you asked me that. it was one of my more brilliant ideas, between you me, that’s saying something. you see, only one who wanted to find find it, but not use it would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life. my brain surprises even me sometimes. ... now, enough questions. i suggest you make a start on these sweets. ah! bertie bott’s every flavor beans! i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one, since then i’m afraid i’ve rather lost my liking for them but i think i’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?” he smiled popped golden-brown bean into his mouth. then he choked said, ear wax!” madam pomfrey, nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. five minutes,” pleaded. not.” let professor dumbledore in. ...” of course, that was headmaster, quite different. you need rest.” am resting, look, lying down everything. oh, go on, madam pomfrey ...” very well,” she said. five minutes only.” she let ron hermione in. hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. harry, we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried whole school’s talking about it,” said ron. really happened?” it was one of those rare occasions when true story is even more strange exciting than wild rumors. told them everything: quirrell; mirror; stone; voldemort. ron hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all right places, when told them what was under quirrell’s turban, hermione screamed out loud. stone’s gone?” said ron finally. just going to die?” what i said, but dumbledore thinks that what was it? well-organized mind, death is but next great adventure.’ always said he was off his rocker,” said ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. what happened to you two?” said harry. i got back all right,” said hermione. brought ron round that took a while we were dashing up to owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in entrance hall he already knew he just said, gone after him, hasn’t he?’ hurtled off to third floor.” think he meant you to do it?” said ron. you your fathers cloak everything?” hermione exploded, he did i mean to say that’s terrible you could have been killed.” it isn’t,” said thoughtfully. a funny man, dumbledore. i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. i don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how mirror worked. it’s almost like he thought i had right to face voldemort if i could. ...” dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said ron proudly. you’ve got to be up for end- of-year feast tomorrow. points are all in slytherin won, of course you missed last quidditch match, we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but food’ll be good.” at that moment, madam pomfrey bustled over. had nearly fifteen minutes, now out,” she said firmly. k k after a good night’s sleep, felt nearly back to normal. want to go to feast,” he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. can, can’t i?” dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be. you have another visitor.” good,” said harry. is it?” hagrid sidled through door as he spoke. as usual when he was indoors, hagrid looked too big to be allowed. he sat down next to harry, took one look at him, burst into tears. all my ruddy fault!” he sobbed, his face in his hands. told evil git how ter get past fluffy! i told him! it was only thing he didn’t know, an’ i told him! yeh could’ve died! all fer a dragon egg! i’ll never drink again! i should be chucked out an’ made ter live as a muggle!” said harry, shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. he’d have found out somehow, this is voldemort we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.” could’ve died!” sobbed hagrid. don’ say name!” bellowed, hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. met him i’m calling him by his name. please cheer up, hagrid, we saved stone, it’s gone, he can’t use it. have a chocolate frog, i’ve got loads. ...” hagrid wiped his nose on back of his hand said, reminds me. i’ve got yeh a present.” not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said anxiously, at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle. dumbledore gave me day off yesterday ter fix it. he shoulda sacked me instead anyway, got y eh this ...” it seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. opened it curiously. it was full of wizard photographs. smiling waving at him from every were his mother father. owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh like it?” couldn’t speak, but hagrid understood. made his way down to end-of-year feast alone that night. he had been held up by madam pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so great hall was already full. it was decked out in slytherin colors of green silver to celebrate slytherin winning house cup for seventh year in a row. a huge banner showing slytherin serpent covered wall behind high table. when walked in there was a sudden hush, then everybody started talking loudly at once. he slipped into a seat between ron hermione at gryffindor table tried to ignore fact that people were standing up to look at him. fortunately, dumbledore arrived moments later. babble died away. year gone!” dumbledore said cheerfully. i must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. what a year it has been! hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have whole summer ahead to get them nice empty before next year starts. ... as i understand it, house cup here needs awarding, points stand thus: in fourth place, gryffindor, with three hundred twelve points; in third, hufflepuff, with three hundred fifty-two; ravenclaw has four hundred twenty-six slytherin, four hundred seventy- two.” a storm of cheering stamping broke out from slytherin table. could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on table. it was a sickening sight. yes, well done, slytherin,” said dumbledore. recent events must be taken into account.” room went very still. slytherins’ smiles faded a little. said dumbledore. have a few last-minute points to dish out. let me see. yes ... to mr. ronald weasley ...” ron went purple in face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \"... for best-played game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years, i award gryffindor house fifty points.” gryffindor cheers nearly raised bewitched ceiling; stars overhead seemed to quiver. percy could be heard telling other prefects, brother, you know! my youngest brother! got past mcgonagall’s giant chess set!” at last there was silence again. to miss hermione granger . . . for use of cool logic in face of fire, i award gryffindor house fifty points.” hermione buried her face in her arms; strongly suspected she had burst into tears. gryffindors up down table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up. to mr. ...” said dumbledore. room went deadly quiet. \"... for pure nerve outstanding courage, i award gryffindor house sixty points.” din was deafening. those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred seventy-two points exactly same as slytherin. they had tied for house cup if only dumbledore had given just one more point. dumbledore raised his hand. room gradually fell silent. are all kinds of courage,” said dumbledore, smiling. takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. i therefore award ten points to mr. neville longbottom.” someone standing outside great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was noise that erupted from gryffindor table. harry, ron, hermione stood up to yell cheer as neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before. harry, still cheering, nudged ron in ribs pointed at malfoy, who couldn’t have looked more stunned horrified if he’d just had body-bind curse put on him. means,” dumbledore called over storm of applause, for even ravenclaw hufflepuff were celebrating downfall of slytherin, need a little change of decoration.” he clapped his hands. in an instant, green hangings became scarlet silver became gold; huge slytherin serpent vanished a towering gryffindor lion took its place. snape was shaking professor mcgonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. he caught harry’s eye knew at once that snape feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. this didn’t worry harry. it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at hogwarts. it was best evening of harry’s life, better than winning at quidditch, or christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. had almost forgotten that exam results were still to come, but come they did. to their great surprise, both he ron passed with good marks; hermione, of course, had best grades of first years. even neville scraped through, his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one. they had hoped that goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. it was a shame, but as ron said, you couldn’t have everything in life. suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over holidays (“i always hope they’ll forget to give us these,” said fred weasley sadly); hagrid was there to take them down to fleet of boats that sailed across lake; they were boarding hogwarts express; talking laughing as countryside became greener tidier; eating bertie bott’s every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes putting on jackets coats; pulling into platform nine three-quarters at king’s cross station. it took quite a while for them all to get off platform. a wizened old guard was up by ticket barrier, letting them go through gate in twos threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once alarming muggles. must come stay this summer,” said ron, of you i’ll send you an owl.” said harry, need something to look forward to.” people jostled them as they moved forward toward gateway back to muggle world. some of them called: harry!” you, potter!” famous,” said ron, grinning at him. where i’m going, i promise you,” said harry. he, ron, hermione passed through gateway together. he is, mom, there he is, look!” it was ginny weasley, ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at ron. potter!” she squealed. mom! i can see quiet, ginny, it’s rude to point.” mrs. weasley smiled down at them. year?” she said. said harry. for fudge sweater, mrs. weasley.” it was nothing, dear.” are you?” it was uncle vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at nerve of harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. behind him stood aunt petunia dudley, looking terrified at very sight of harry. must be harry’s family!” said mrs. weasley. a manner of speaking,” said uncle vernon. up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” he walked away. hung back for a last word with ron hermione. you over summer, then.” you have er a good holiday,” said hermione, looking uncertainly after uncle vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. i will,” said harry, they were surprised at grin that was spreading over his face. they don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home. i’m going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer...” \n"
